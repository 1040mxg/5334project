	Business climate worsens for Taiwan's service sector		
	12/5/2020 20:42		
	TAIPEI, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The business climate for Taiwan's service industries has been worsening in recent months, as shown by two key indicators, according to Taipei-based Commerce Development Research Institute (CDRI).		
The Cyclical Coincident Composite Index for Service Industries, gauging the current business climate for service industries, dropped from 0.3228 points in May 2019 to -0.208 points in October, falling consistently for a period of 17 months, the CDRI said in a research report released earlier this week.			
The decline has been steeper since the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, the report said.			
A reading between 0 to 1.5 on the indicator suggests recovery and above 1.5 suggests prosperity. Meanwhile, a reading between 0 to -1.5 suggests slowdown and below -1.5 indicates depression.			
The Cyclical Leading Composite Index for Service Industries, gauging the future changes in business climate, has also been in decline, dropping over a period of 26 months from September 2018 to October this year, the report said.			
The report attributed the worsening business climate for service industries to shrinking private consumption, particularly amid the COVID-19 pandemic.			
The long-term structural problems in Taiwan service industries, such as low productivity and competitiveness, also contributed to the continuous decline, the CDRI report added.			
It suggested that service industries should seize the opportunities provided by the digital economy and upgrade their business models and strategies. Enditem"

	Zero tolerance for serious illegal acts against judicial officer: HKSAR gov't		
	12/5/2020 18:58		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- In response to the criminal intimidation against a judicial officer, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government issued a statement on Saturday saying that it will not tolerate such acts.		
A judicial officer in performing his judicial duties has received intimidation threatening to hurt his family members, with an attempt to influence the court decisions. The HKSAR government and any law-abiding jurisdiction will not tolerate such violent and illegal acts, said the statement.			
The police are taking resolute enforcement action so as to apprehend the culprit as soon as possible and safeguard Hong Kong's public peace and safety, the statement added.			
The HKSAR government said that members of the public have the right to express their views or engage in discussions on court decisions and related matters within the boundary permitted by the law. However, one must respect the judicial independence when expressing their views, and should not arbitrarily attack members of the judiciary.			
The Department of Justice (DoJ) of the HKSAR government said any person who is dissatisfied with court decisions may lodge appeals through the legal mechanism and should not criticize judicial officers abusively or even intimidate them.			
The DoJ strongly appealed to all members of the communities to stop attacking Hong Kong's judicial system by any means. These acts may breach the laws including the national security law in the HKSAR.			
The unlawful radical behavior is not acceptable in Hong Kong society and the HKSAR government will follow up on all the illegal acts in accordance with the law to safeguard public peace in a steadfast manner, said the statement. Enditem"

	Spokesperson condemns foreign politicians' meddling in Hong Kong's rule of law		
	12/5/2020 01:38		
	BEIJING, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese central government spokesperson on Friday condemned "a small number of politicians" in the United States and Britain for making groundless accusations against the sentencing of Joshua Wong and two other persons by Hong Kong judicial organs, warning they must stop supporting those who disrupt Hong Kong and antagonize China.		
The spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said those foreign politicians interfered in and undermined the rule of law and judicial independence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).			
Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow incited thousands of people to besiege the Hong Kong police headquarters on June 21, 2019.			
A court in Hong Kong handed down their sentences after the three defendants pleaded guilty over irrefutable evidence that proved their crimes in court.			
However, a small number of U.S. and British politicians just ignored the facts and smeared the legitimate law enforcement, prosecuting and judging by the HKSAR and made ""absurd demand"" of releasing the convicts, the spokesperson said.			
It is extremely unreasonable for them to exert pressure and threaten sanctions, the spokesperson said, calling their acts flagrant interference in the HKSAR's rule of law and judicial independence, as well as gross meddling in China's internal affairs.			
Wong and the ilk have received multiple prison sentences after they have long advocated ""Hong Kong independence,"" established extremist and separatist organizations, colluded with ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists, and incited students to participate in the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement, the spokesperson said.			
Wong willingly acted as a pawn of external anti-China forces and incited riots under the guise of ""democracy,"" bringing chaos to Hong Kong and harm to the students, the spokesperson said, calling Wong one of the major culprits who undermined Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.			
Such foreign politicians cannot wait to help Wong and their other political agents escape punishment, thus exposing their attempts to use radicals to create chaos in Hong Kong under the guise of supporting the HKSAR's democracy and freedom, said the spokesperson.			
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, its human rights and freedom, including freedom of speech and assembly, have been fully protected by the Constitution and the HKSAR Basic Law, the spokesperson stressed.			
However, the exercise of rights is limited by the law, the spokesperson said, noting that no one has the freedom of damaging others' safety and property, undermining society's prosperity and stability, or challenging national sovereignty, security, and development interests.			
No foreign or external forces will succeed in forcing China's central government and the HKSAR government to give up safeguarding the rule of law, the spokesperson said.			
The 1.4 billion Chinese people, including the residents of Hong Kong, will never allow it, the spokesperson said. Enditem"

	HKSAR LegCo approves funds for studies on massive reclamation project		
	12/4/2020 23:43		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Legislative Council (LegCo) on Friday approved a funding request of 550 million Hong Kong dollars (about 70.9 million U.S. dollars) for feasibility studies on a massive reclamation project off Lantau.		
Secretary for Development of the HKSAR government Michael Wong said he was confident that the whole project can move forward, stressing that the administration has been engaged in dialogue with the society on different possibilities.			
He also promised that the HKSAR government will report to the LegCo every year on the progress of the studies.			
The HKSAR government introduced the ""Lantau Tomorrow Vision"" in 2018 in a bid to increase land supply, improve people's livelihood and promote economic development. The plan is to build 1,700 hectares of artificial islands, offering housing to 700,000 to 1.1 million people starting 2032 at the earliest.

	Safeguarding national sovereignty, security, development interests, the untouchable bottom line of "one country, two systems": HKSAR chief executive		
	12/4/2020 23:35		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- Safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests is the fundamental purpose of the Constitution and the untouchable bottom line of the "one country, two systems" principle, and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), as an inseparable part of the country, has a clear responsibility to safeguard national security, HKSAR chief executive Carrie Lam said Friday.		
Speaking at an online symposium marking the country's seventh Constitution Day, Lam said the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country and has the highest legal status and effect throughout the country, including the HKSAR.			
The Constitution and the Basic Law together constitute the constitutional order of the HKSAR and stipulate its various systems. Therefore, in order to fully and accurately implement ""one country, two systems"", one must act in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, she said.			
According to Lam, over the past 23 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the Hong Kong society's understanding of the Constitution and the Basic Law is still inadequate. In addition, people with ulterior motives deliberately distorted the relationship between the central authorities and the HKSAR, and even set ""one country"" and ""two systems"" against each other, which has led to many disputes, contradictions and even antagonisms in the Hong Kong society.			
What urgently needs to be done now is to get the constitutional order and political system in the HKSAR back on track, she added.			
To set things right, Lam stressed the importance in public education. In order to promote the Constitution, and to mark the annual National Constitution Day, the HKSAR government organized a series of public education activities and gave some suggestions to schools, hoping to make students get to know the Constitution from an early age and enhance their national concept.			
The theme of this year's symposium is ""Constitution and National Security"". Lam stressed that national security is a top priority for every country. If the country is not secure, the livelihood of its people cannot be guaranteed and the country cannot develop. Therefore, national security has always been the responsibility of the central authorities, which is also an international practice.			
She pointed out that since last June, the Hong Kong community has experienced many challenges. A series of violent incidents and intervention by external forces have not only caused serious damage to Hong Kong's social security and economy, but also posed a serious threat to national security. The national security law in Hong Kong, legislated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and promulgated and implemented in the HKSAR in accordance with the Basic Law, not only provides a solid foundation for maintaining Hong Kong's social prosperity and stability, but also creates new opportunities and instills new impetus into Hong Kong's economic development.			
Lam stressed that while promoting the understanding of the Constitution and the Basic Law, publicity and education on the national security law in Hong Kong must also be strengthened and relevant knowledge should be promoted among the public in a serious and earnest manner.			
She hoped that people from all walks of life will actively respond to the promotion of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the national security law in Hong Kong, so that the younger generation can better understand and abide by the law, fulfill their obligations to safeguard national security and ensure the steady and long-term development of ""one country, two systems"".			
Lam said that apart from the symposium, relevant departments of the HKSAR government will continue to vigorously promote the publicity and education of the Constitution and the Basic Law at different levels. In particular, the promotion of the Constitution among public officers, teachers and young people should be more thorough and effective. Enditem"

	Liaison office director in HKSAR says Hong Kong must respect Constitution, safeguard national security		
	12/4/2020 23:12		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- Luo Huining, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said on Friday that the Hong Kong society must fully respect the Constitution, genuinely safeguard national security, and adhere to the norm of patriots governing Hong Kong.		
Luo made the remarks when addressing an online symposium organized by the HKSAR government to mark China's seventh National Constitution Day falling on Friday.			
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the Constitution and the HKSAR Basic Law have been effectively implemented and the ""one country, two systems"" practice has also made enormous achievements, Luo said.			
Only under the Constitution and the Basic Law, which jointly form Hong Kong's constitutional foundation, can the high degree of autonomy be implemented, the rule of law be upheld, and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability be sustained, Luo said.			
National security is the top interest protected under the Constitution, Luo said, stressing that without national security, there will be no ""one country, two systems"" and no Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.			
The national security law in the HKSAR has been effective over the past months and Hong Kong has entered a crucial period of returning to peace from chaos, Luo said.			
He also noted that many articles of the national security law still need to be translated into a comprehensive mechanism, become a code of conduct for the general public, and be genuinely implemented by the executive, law-enforcing and judicial organs of the HKSAR.			
Hong Kong has always shared the same destiny with the motherland and only under the governance of patriots, can Hong Kong achieve long-term development, Luo added.			
The decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the qualification of HKSAR Legislative Council members set clearly the bottom line and political norm of ""patriots governing Hong Kong"", which ensures that political figures uphold the Constitution and the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the country and the HKSAR, and those who oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong are out, Luo said.

	HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will cancel its annual New Year Countdown fireworks display and Chinese Lunar New Year parade due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said the events' organizer the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Friday.		
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has announced tightened social distancing measures to suppress the spread of the COVID-19 as a new wave of the pandemic hits the region, the board explained in a statement.			
Playing its part in fighting the virus, the HKTB said it has made new arrangements for upcoming mega events including New Year Countdown Celebrations and Chinese Lunar New Year Celebrations.			
As regards annual New Year Countdown Celebrations to be held at midnight of Dec. 31 each year, the board said there will be no fireworks display over Victoria Harbour for this year's New Year Countdown due to the need to uphold social distancing measures.

	Joshua Wong, two others' imprisonment shows rule of law: various sectors in Hong Kong		
	12/4/2020 19:06		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 4 (Xinhua) -- People from various sectors in Hong Kong said the imprisonment of Joshua Wong and two other persons demonstrates the rule of law in the special administrative region (SAR), and the sentencing will contribute to helping Hong Kong restore peace and stability.		
Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow were sentenced to 13.5, seven and 10 months in prison respectively on Wednesday for besieging the Hong Kong police headquarters in June 2019. They were members of the disbanded Demosisto, a separatist group advocating ""Hong Kong independence.""			
Besieging the police headquarters is a serious offense and threatens public security, Chow Ho-ding, vice chairperson of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said, stressing that when the police are under attack, ordinary residents could face greater threats.			
Leung Mei-fun, a member of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, said the sentencing of Wong, Lam and Chow sent a clear signal to society that those who break the law must bear the responsibility.			
Sze Wing-wai, head of Hong Kong CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) (Provincial) Members Association, said many young people descended to criminals in recent years due to the incitement of Wong and other instigators of riots, and that he hoped the sentencing will raise the public awareness of the rule of law.			
Lau Ka-keung, head of Hong Kong United Youth Association, said the advocacy of ""Hong Kong independence"" and the rampant violence have been curbed since the national security law in the Hong Kong SAR took effect and urged joint efforts to push Hong Kong back on track.			
Multiple civil organizations expressed support to the sentencing of Wong, Lam and Chow and urged the police to conduct thorough investigations into the three persons' other offenses under the national security law. Enditem"

	Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HKSAR strongly opposes U.S. report		
	12/2/2020 20:38		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) expressed Wednesday firm opposition against the latest annual report of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission that interferes in Hong Kong affairs, China's internal affairs.		
The report is full of bias and applies double standards, a spokesperson of the office said in a statement.			
The spokesperson said the report heaps abuses on China's moves to safeguard national security but ignores that the United States has long abused the concept of national security.			
The report attacks the protective jurisdiction of the national security law in the HKSAR but mentions nothing about the United States' exercise of long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, the spokesperson said.			
The report vilifies the HKSAR's decision to postpone Legislative Council (LegCo) election but turns a blind eye to the delay or cancellation of elections in over a dozen U.S. states, the spokesperson said.			
The report criticizes the requirement of LegCo members to fulfill their constitutional obligation to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR, but neglects the United States' requirement of members of the Congress to swear to support the U.S. Constitution, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson said that the report distorts the fact by accusing China of undermining ""one country, two systems.""			
The Chinese central government has implemented ""one country, two systems"" in strict accordance with the Constitution of China and the Hong Kong Basic Law, the spokesperson said, stressing that Hong Kong's international rankings for freedoms, judicial system and the rule of law have surged and its people are enjoying extensive rights and freedoms unimaginable in the colonial era.			
The national security legislation for Hong Kong by the central authorities this year aims to plug legal loopholes in safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has made a decision to reaffirm the political ethics and legal principle that Hong Kong shall be governed by those loving both the country and Hong Kong, while those sowing trouble in Hong Kong and China at large should be out, the spokesperson said.			
The efforts stayed committed to the original aspiration of ""one country, two systems,"" improved its institutional framework and ensured the enduring success of the policy, which have gained broad support among the 1.4 billion Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots and the international community and marked a major turning point for Hong Kong to regain its stability, the spokesperson said.			
The anti-China forces have colluded to deny and challenge ""one country"" on the pretext of ""two systems,"" the spokesperson said.			
The United States revoked Hong Kong's status as a separate customs territory, predicted doom and gloom for Hong Kong's business environment, and endorsed the attempt to paralyze the body of power of the HKSAR by those with a ""burn with us"" mentality and criminals, the spokesperson said.			
It goes without saying who is safeguarding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and who is undermining ""one country, two systems,"" the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson pointed out that the report lambastes the efforts by the central and HKSAR governments to address root problems and set things right, recommends extending political asylum to and removing visa barriers for anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, and resorts to the old tactic of sanctions.			
It is a flagrant interference with Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, a clumsy show to put domestic laws above international laws, and a contravention of international laws and basic norms governing international relations, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China, and its affairs are China's internal affairs, which allow no external interference, adding that the annual report has no credibility at all.			
Hong Kong's future is closely intertwined with its motherland and ""one country, two systems"" will stand unaffected by any smear campaign, the spokesperson said.			
The attempts to play Hong Kong as a card to contain China, and to meddle with and exert maximum pressure on China are doomed to fail, the spokesperson said, urging certain U.S. politicians to act prudently and refrain from further interference. Enditem"

	It goes without saying who is safeguarding Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and who is undermining "one country, two systems," the spokesperson said.		
	The spokesperson pointed out that the report lambastes the efforts by the central and HKSAR governments to address root problems and set things right, recommends extending political asylum to and removing visa barriers for anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, and resorts to the old tactic of sanctions.		
	It is a flagrant interference with Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, a clumsy show to put domestic laws above international laws, and a contravention of international laws and basic norms governing international relations, the spokesperson said.		
	The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China, and its affairs are China's internal affairs, which allow no external interference, adding that the annual report has no credibility at all.		
	Hong Kong's future is closely intertwined with its motherland and "one country, two systems" will stand unaffected by any smear campaign, the spokesperson said.		
	The attempts to play Hong Kong as a card to contain China, and to meddle with and exert maximum pressure on China are doomed to fail, the spokesperson said, urging certain U.S. politicians to act prudently and refrain from further interference. Enditem		
	HKSAR gov't refutes groundless accusations of U.S. report		
	12/2/2020 19:34		
	HONG KONG, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Wednesday vehemently refuted a report issued by a U.S. congressional commission and firmly opposed the sweeping attacks and unfounded accusations in the Chapter on Hong Kong.		
A spokesman for the HKSAR government said the report by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission is another vivid example of the blatant interference by the United States in Hong Kong's affairs, following the U.S. Congress' successive passage of a host of laws against the HKSAR.			
It is hypocritical for the United States to introduce measures to attack China by creating issues in the HKSAR using the excuse of human rights, democracy and autonomy.""			
The spokesman stressed that it is totally untrue and biased to say that the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR pays no regard to the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people or undermines the high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR.			
Since the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong, stability has been restored to society and national security has been safeguarded in the HKSAR. Hong Kong people can continue to enjoy their basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law.			
Referring to the report's misguided views on Hong Kong's role as an international financial center, the spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong's financial markets and linked exchange rate system had continued to operate in a stable and orderly manner following the implementation of the national security law.			
The HKSAR government has the determination and capability to safeguard Hong Kong's long-term prosperity, stability and financial security for investors to continue operating here,"" said the spokesman.			
Capitalizing on the strengths of 'one country, two systems,' Hong Kong will harness the tremendous opportunities presented by the sustained reform and opening-up of the mainland market buttressed by Hong Kong's adherence to and connectivity with international rules and standards. Hong Kong's status as an international financial center will not change.""			
The HKSAR government will continue to discharge its duty to safeguard national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law and without fear or anxiety and will not be intimated by the so-called sanctions unjustifiably imposed by foreign countries, said the spokesman.			
With the Central People's Government's support, the HKSAR government will strive to forge ahead with renewed perseverance, he added. Enditem"

HONG KONG, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- As daily COVID-19 infections remained high, Hong Kong announced an array of measures on Monday afternoon in order to control the worsening epidemic situation with more entertainment venues to be closed and heavier punishment for violations of social distancing and other restrictions in the pipeline.			
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam unveiled the new policies at a press conference and stressed that the local COVID-19 situation was still severe.			
Among the stricter measures, for 14 days starting Wednesday, are that amusement arcades, karaoke lounges, mahjong parlors and swimming pools will be closed, and that the number of diners at each table of restaurants will be capped at two. Public gatherings of more than two people will also be prohibited.			
The HKSAR government also plans to significantly increase the current 2,000-Hong Kong-dollar (258-U.S.-dollar) fine for people violating social distancing rules.			
Lam said the local government staff, except those providing urgent and necessary services, will start to work at home, and called on private and public employers also to allow remote working.			
The new measures came as 115 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on Sunday, the highest notch in nearly four months. The daily increase retreated mildly to 76 with the majority being local infections on Monday.			
Lam stressed the severity of the new round of epidemic outbreak and said the increasing number of infections with unknown origins pointed to the existence of invisible transmission chains in the community.			
To stop the coronavirus spread, the government will step up efforts to screen COVID-19 patients, including putting into operation five more testing centers in the community. Three quarantine centers that were closed will reopen, and the government will arrange two hotels for close contacts of confirmed patients.			
Hong Kong's COVID-19 tally accumulated to more than 6,300 by Tuesday. Enditem"

HONG KONG, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- As a series of support measures were unveiled in the new policy address on Wednesday, Hong Kong, still reeling from social unrest and the COVID-19 epidemic, is expected to gain momentum to revive its ailing economy, integrate into steady development of the country, and realize greater achievements in the future.			
TAPPING INTO GREATER BAY AREA			
Observers said the measures to help Hong Kong better participate in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area became the major bright spot of the policy address.			
With the great support of the central government, Hong Kong should make full use of the opportunities in the Greater Bay Area and actively integrate into the national development landscape so as to enjoy the dividends of the country's robust growth, Hong Kong-based economist Liang Haiming said.			
The new measures, among seven aspects of policy support by the central government, were tangible, detailed and practical, Chan Yung, vice-chairperson of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said.			
Guo Yiming, deputy chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, pointed out that further integration into the Greater Bay Area means easier cross-boundary travel, wider mutual financial market access and deepening innovation and technology cooperation, which will enable Hong Kong to break its development bottleneck.			
The Greater Bay Area will also provide young people in Hong Kong with a much broader arena, observers said.			
According to the policy address, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government will earmark 100 million Hong Kong dollars (12.9 billion U.S. dollars) to subsidize nearly 200 startups of young entrepreneurs in the Greater Bay Area. Some 2,000 Hong Kong college graduates will get the opportunities of working in the mainland Greater Bay Area cities under a government scheme.			
As the new policy address highlighted opportunities in the national development, Hong Kong will be able to find new economic growth points, facilitate better development of the young people, and overcome the current impasse, observers said.			
REINFORCING FINANCIAL HUB			
The policy address also featured an array of measures to consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, in particular the further deepening of the mutual access between the mainland and Hong Kong financial markets.			
The central authorities will support the gradual expansion of the scope of eligible securities under stock connect programs, including the inclusion of Hong Kong-listed pre-profit biotechnology companies and stocks traded on the mainland Sci-Tech Innovation Board, according to the policy address.			
The implementation of the cross-boundary wealth management connect scheme will also be expedited.			
Tan Yueheng, permanent honorary president of the Chinese Securities Association of Hong Kong, said the new policies will bolster the sustainable development of financial markets, bring new impetus into the Hong Kong economy and cement Hong Kong's role as a financial hub and a wealth management center.			
The further expansion of stock connect programs will help ensure the continued resiliency, vibrancy and attractiveness of Hong Kong's capital markets, Laura Cha Shih May-lung, chairperson of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, said.			
With the new measures to facilitate mutual access of financial markets, capital flows between the mainland and Hong Kong will be more smooth, Cheng Shi, chief economist with ICBC International, said, expecting more global funds into the mainland markets.			
ADDRESSING PEOPLE'S CONCERNS			
With concrete measures tackling difficulties of Hong Kong residents, the policy address received a positive response from observers and political figures.			
As people suffering from a battered economy had warm anticipation for the policy address, the HKSAR government did respond to the public concerns and put forward targeted measures, including pro-employment policies, Chan Yung said.			
The government plans to make infrastructure investment of more than 100 billion Hong Kong dollars each year and continue to push forward the Job Creation Scheme, under which 10,000 jobs have been filled in public and private sectors, remarkable progress to realize the 29,000-job targets.			
Such tangible measures will be a great encouragement to the public,"" Chan said.			
Guo Yiming described new measures on housing and land as a breakthrough of the policy address and said a solution to Hong Kong's entrenched housing problem has taken shape.			
According to the policy address, the government has identified 330 hectares of land required to meet the demand for about 301,000 public housing units in the coming 10 years, and low-income families waiting for public rental housing will be granted cash allowance.			
The measures showed the resolve of the government to revive the economy and improve people's livelihood, Chong Tai-leung, associate professor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said. Enditem

	DPP's "decoupling" scheme will further hurt Taiwan economy: spokesperson		
	11/25/2020 21:41		
	BEIJING, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson said Wednesday that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan will only bring more obstacles to the island's economic development by seeking a so-claimed economic "decoupling" across the Taiwan Strait.		
Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks when responding to questions regarding cross-Strait economic relations.			
Ten years ago, Chinese mainland and Taiwan signed the cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) based on the common political foundation of upholding the 1992 Consensus, which has produced enormous benefits for companies and residents on both sides.			
However, the DPP spares no efforts to obstruct and limit trade exchanges and cooperation across the Strait for its own political interests, Zhu said.			
Obstructing the implementation of the agreement on service trade under the ECFA, the DPP took away the strategic development opportunities from Taiwan compatriots and enterprises they could have enjoyed, Zhu noted.			
Zhu pointed out that Taiwan had the opportunity of engaging in regional economic cooperation when its authorities upheld the 1992 Consensus and under the background of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, but the DPP ruined the prospect as it refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus.

	However, the DPP spares no efforts to obstruct and limit trade exchanges and cooperation across the Strait for its own political interests, Zhu said.		
	Obstructing the implementation of the agreement on service trade under the ECFA, the DPP took away the strategic development opportunities from Taiwan compatriots and enterprises they could have enjoyed, Zhu noted.		
	Zhu pointed out that Taiwan had the opportunity of engaging in regional economic cooperation when its authorities upheld the 1992 Consensus and under the background of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, but the DPP ruined the prospect as it refused to recognize the 1992 Consensus.

	Explainer: Key takeaways of HKSAR chief executive's 2020 policy address		
	11/25/2020 19:35		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam delivered the 2020 policy address Wednesday. Here are several key messages:		
-- The central authorities will fully support Hong Kong's development in seven aspects, namely promoting the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center and international aviation hub, and developing Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology hub, improving the infrastructure of land boundary control points between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, facilitating Hong Kong enterprises to tap the mainland domestic market, and fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic.			
-- Over the past four months or so, the national security law in Hong Kong has been remarkably effective in restoring stability in Hong Kong: advocacies of ""Hong Kong independence"" and collusions with external forces have progressively subsided; some of the prominent figures have kept a low profile; radical organizations have ceased operation or dissolved; those who are suspected of violating the law have absconded; and street violence is significantly on the decline.			
-- In view of the unstable situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong, it is essential to take all necessary measures to strengthen epidemic control to achieve ""zero infection,"" even implementing a large-scale universal community testing again.			
-- The HKSAR government forecasts the economy to contract by 6.1 percent in 2020.			
-- To bring continuous impetus to its economy, Hong Kong can focus on the business opportunities in the mainland market, better integrate into the overall development of the country, take the GBA development as an entry point, and proactively become a ""participant"" in domestic circulation and a ""facilitator"" in international circulation.			
-- Hong Kong's insurance industry will be supported to establish after-sales service centers in the mainland cities of the GBA under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA).			
-- The HKSAR government has identified 330 hectares of land to meet the demand for about 301,000 public housing units in the coming 10 years.			
-- Recurrent government expenditures on social welfare and healthcare have registered an average annual increase of 12.9 percent and 11.6 percent respectively from 2017-2018 to 2020-2021.			
-- The 5G coverage of major mobile network operators is expected to reach 90 percent of the population this year.			
-- The HKSAR government will launch the Greater Bay Area Youth Employment Scheme to encourage enterprises with operation in both Hong Kong and the GBA to recruit and deploy 2,000 local university graduates to work in the mainland cities of the GBA.			
-- To render better entrepreneurial support and incubation services to Hong Kong young people who intend to start their businesses in Hong Kong and the mainland cities of the GBA, about 100 million Hong Kong dollars will be provided for nearly 200 youth start-ups and supporting services to about 4,000 young people.

	DPP authorities should stop obstructing mainland journalists: spokesperson

	Central authorities to fully support Hong Kong's development in 7 aspects: HKSAR chief executive		
	11/25/2020 17:31		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that the central authorities will fully support measures conducive to maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, improving the well-being of Hong Kong residents, and promoting greater integration of Hong Kong into the overall development of the country.		
Lam made the remarks while delivering the 2020 policy address.			
In the past year, Hong Kong has experienced multiple blows, including the COVID-19 epidemic and the social unrest in the second half of 2019, that caused shrinking economy and rising unemployment rate. The promulgation of the national security law in the HKSAR on June 30 this year has restored stability in society, but the road to economic recovery is still fraught with difficulties, she said.			
On the other hand, we have seen a quick rebound in the economy of our country as a result of its vigorous efforts in putting the epidemic under control,"" she noted.			
Benefiting from its proximity to the mainland and the central authorities' long-standing support under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong's economic development will be given new impetus,"" said Lam.			
It can continue to capitalize on its strengths to serve the country's needs with proactive participation in the domestic and international dual circulation as well as better integration into the overall national development.""			
Lam in early November held discussions with the relevant central authorities as well as the Guangdong provincial government on policy initiatives that will support Hong Kong's development and enhance the community's confidence in the future.			
On promoting the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), the central authorities, in addition to the measures rolled out earlier such as tax concessions, facilitation of property purchase, support for young entrepreneurs, cross-boundary remittance of science and technology funding and liberalization of legal and construction professional services, will soon introduce further measures including permitting the use of Hong Kong-registered drugs and common medical devices in designated Hong Kong-owned healthcare institutions in the mainland cities of the GBA, relaxing the limitation on exporting mainland human genetic resources to Hong Kong for research purposes, facilitating Hong Kong private cars travelling to Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB), and expediting the implementation of the cross-boundary wealth management connect scheme.			
On consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, the central authorities support further deepening the mutual access between the mainland and Hong Kong financial markets and the gradual expansion of the scope of eligible securities under the mutual market access programs, and agree to accelerate the pace of the inclusion of pre-profit biotechnology companies listed in Hong Kong and stocks listed on the mainland Sci-Tech Innovation Board meeting certain prescribed criteria in the scope of eligible securities under the programs.			
On consolidating and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub, the central authorities support the participation of the Hong Kong International Airport in the operation and development of the Zhuhai Airport through investment by way of share acquisition according to market principles, with a view to deepening the co-operation of the two airports in building a globally competitive world-class airport cluster.			
On the development of an international innovation and technology (I&T) hub, the central authorities support the joint development of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong I&T Co-operation Zone, which comprises the Shenzhen I&T Zone and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen I&T Park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop, with a view to establishing ""one zone, two parks"" at ""one river, two banks"" under the auspices of ""one country, two systems.""			
On improving the infrastructure of land boundary control points between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, the central authorities support the deepening of cooperation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, the enhancement of the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang control point, and the implementation of co-location arrangements at the new Huanggang control point in Shenzhen so as to release over 20 hectares of land at the Hong Kong control point for other uses.			
We will also explore with Shenzhen the enhancement of the Lo Wu control point in due course. Drawing on the experience of Hong Kong private cars travelling to Guangdong via the HZMB, we will explore the implementation of the same policy at other Hong Kong/Shenzhen land boundary control points,"" she said.			
On facilitating Hong Kong enterprises to tap the mainland domestic market, the central authorities support the collaboration of the Guangdong province with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and relevant chambers of commerce in providing policy advisory, training and business matching services to Hong Kong enterprises, thereby enabling them to expand their domestic sale channels and establish interface with the e-commerce platforms in the mainland market.			
On fighting against the epidemic, the central authorities support and request the HKSAR government to adopt all necessary measures to guard against the importation of cases and resurgence of domestic infections, with the aim of gradually resuming travel between Hong Kong and Guangdong in an orderly manner through mutual recognition of health codes when the epidemic situation in Hong Kong stabilizes.			
The central authorities also support Hong Kong in ensuring the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and will reserve a certain amount of vaccines developed or produced in the mainland for use by Hong Kong residents when necessary.			
Such strong policy support from the central authorities is conducive to Hong Kong's putting forward and implementing concrete measures in various areas, Lam said, adding that the HKSAR government will strengthen its communication and interface with relevant central ministries and the Guangdong provincial government, and set up task forces to take forward various initiatives.			
However, to drive forward the development of various sectors in Hong Kong, we need to comprehensively and accurately implement the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy,"" she said. Enditem"

HONG KONG, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam delivered the 2020 policy address Wednesday at a meeting of the HKSAR Legislative Council, highlighting support from the central authorities for Hong Kong to overcome the economic recession.			
The policy address, the fourth one since Lam took office in 2017, came as Hong Kong strives to recover from the impacts of prolonged social unrest and the COVID-19 epidemic.			
As Hong Kong experienced multiple blows from social unrest to the epidemic, the primary objective of the policy address is to look at ways to get Hong Kong out of the impasse and to restore confidence, Lam said.			
Lam had delayed the release of the policy address, originally scheduled in mid-October, to include supportive measures from the central government for Hong Kong to bring new impetus into the battered economy.			
CENTRAL SUPPORT			
At Wednesday's meeting, Lam cited favorable policies by the central government for Hong Kong to further integrate into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, and boost the development of innovation and technology.			
Lam in particular mentioned the innovation and technology cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, and said Guangdong and Shenzhen governments will support a program of the HKSAR government to help Hong Kong young people to work in mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area.			
With Hong Kong's GDP expected to contract 6.1 percent this year, Lam pointed out that the economic development of the mainland will inject impetus to relaunch the economy of Hong Kong.			
As the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) states a new development pattern featuring ""dual circulation,"" which takes the domestic market as the mainstay while enabling domestic and foreign markets to interact positively with each other, the opportunities for Hong Kong are evident, Lam said.			
Hong Kong can focus on the business opportunities in the mainland market, better integrate into the overall development of the country, take the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development as an entry point, and proactively become a ""participant"" in domestic circulation and a ""facilitator"" in international circulation, Lam said, adding, ""Playing the dual role well will bring continuous impetus to Hong Kong's economy.""			
IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD			
The HKSAR government will implement measures to further improve people's livelihood, from increasing land supplies to building a caring community and looking after the underprivileged, according to the policy address.			
Lam said the government has identified 330 hectares of land required to meet the demand for about 301,000 public housing units in the coming 10 years.			
Recurrent government expenditures on social welfare and health care have increased from 65.3 billion Hong Kong dollars and 62.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2017-2018 to 93.9 billion Hong Kong dollars and 87.1 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2020-2021, respectively, with average annual increases of 12.9 percent and 11.6 percent, Lam said.			
Lam added that additional funding of 300 billion Hong Kong dollars has been earmarked for the development of public health care facilities and health care teaching facilities.			
As Hong Kong's labor market has come under immense pressure due to the epidemic, the government will ""make every effort to restore the economy, create more jobs, increase training and retraining opportunities, step up manpower matching and enhance the safety net of the social welfare system,"" Lam said.			
Lam highlighted measures to create more job opportunities in green, construction and creative sectors, among others, which are particularly suitable for young people graduating in recent years.			
SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SECURITY, UPHOLDING ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS""			
When delivering the policy address, Lam said over the past four months, the national security law in the HKSAR has been remarkably effective in restoring stability in Hong Kong.			
On June 30, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the national security law in the HKSAR and included it in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law. The national security law took effect in Hong Kong on the same day.			
The advocacy of ""Hong Kong independence"" and collusions with external forces have progressively subsided, Lam said, citing radical organizations ceasing operation or dissolving, suspects of violating the law absconding, and street violence significantly on the decline.			
Under the national security law, the principle of respecting and protecting human rights will be upheld and the legitimate rights of Hong Kong residents to exercise their freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration and procession will not be affected, Lam said.			
The Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR with Lam as the chair will do the utmost to effectively prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security, Lam said.			
Under the constitutional function of ""dual responsibility,"" the chief executive is responsible to both the HKSAR and the central government and is required to comprehensively, accurately and firmly implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and uphold the Basic Law, Lam added.

	Lam in particular mentioned the innovation and technology cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, and said Guangdong and Shenzhen governments will support a program of the HKSAR government to help Hong Kong young people to work in mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area.		
	With Hong Kong's GDP expected to contract 6.1 percent this year, Lam pointed out that the economic development of the mainland will inject impetus to relaunch the economy of Hong Kong.		
	As the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) states a new development pattern featuring "dual circulation," which takes the domestic market as the mainstay while enabling domestic and foreign markets to interact positively with each other, the opportunities for Hong Kong are evident, Lam said.		
	Hong Kong can focus on the business opportunities in the mainland market, better integrate into the overall development of the country, take the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development as an entry point, and proactively become a "participant" in domestic circulation and a "facilitator" in international circulation, Lam said, adding, "Playing the dual role well will bring continuous impetus to Hong Kong's economy."		
	IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD		
	The HKSAR government will implement measures to further improve people's livelihood, from increasing land supplies to building a caring community and looking after the underprivileged, according to the policy address.		
	Lam said the government has identified 330 hectares of land required to meet the demand for about 301,000 public housing units in the coming 10 years.		
	Recurrent government expenditures on social welfare and health care have increased from 65.3 billion Hong Kong dollars and 62.6 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2017-2018 to 93.9 billion Hong Kong dollars and 87.1 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2020-2021, respectively, with average annual increases of 12.9 percent and 11.6 percent, Lam said.		
	Lam added that additional funding of 300 billion Hong Kong dollars has been earmarked for the development of public health care facilities and health care teaching facilities.		
	As Hong Kong's labor market has come under immense pressure due to the epidemic, the government will "make every effort to restore the economy, create more jobs, increase training and retraining opportunities, step up manpower matching and enhance the safety net of the social welfare system," Lam said.		
	Lam highlighted measures to create more job opportunities in green, construction and creative sectors, among others, which are particularly suitable for young people graduating in recent years.		
	SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SECURITY, UPHOLDING "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"		
	When delivering the policy address, Lam said over the past four months, the national security law in the HKSAR has been remarkably effective in restoring stability in Hong Kong.		
	On June 30, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the national security law in the HKSAR and included it in Annex III to the HKSAR Basic Law. The national security law took effect in Hong Kong on the same day.		
	The advocacy of "Hong Kong independence" and collusions with external forces have progressively subsided, Lam said, citing radical organizations ceasing operation or dissolving, suspects of violating the law absconding, and street violence significantly on the decline.		
	Under the national security law, the principle of respecting and protecting human rights will be upheld and the legitimate rights of Hong Kong residents to exercise their freedom of speech, press, assembly, demonstration and procession will not be affected, Lam said.		
	The Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR with Lam as the chair will do the utmost to effectively prevent, suppress and punish acts and activities that endanger national security, Lam said.		
	Under the constitutional function of "dual responsibility," the chief executive is responsible to both the HKSAR and the central government and is required to comprehensively, accurately and firmly implement the "one country, two systems" principle and uphold the Basic Law, Lam added.

	HONG KONG, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that the HKSAR government will play the role of "facilitator" and "promoter" well to bring continuous impetus into Hong Kong's economy.

The policy address, the fourth one since Lam took office in 2017, came as Hong Kong strives to recover from the impacts of prolonged unrest and the COVID-19 epidemic.			
As Hong Kong experienced multiple, unprecedented blows from social unrest to the epidemic, the primary objective of the policy address is to look at ways to get Hong Kong out of the impasse and to restore confidence, Lam said.			
At Wednesday's meeting, Lam cited favorable policies for Hong Kong to further integrate into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international financial center, and boost the development of innovation and technology.			
As 2020 marked the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the HKSAR Basic Law, Lam said that to ensure that the ""one country, two systems"" principle is fully and accurately implemented, Hong Kong must adhere to the Constitution and the Basic Law.			
In the past year or so, Hong Kong has experienced the most severe political challenges since its return to the motherland. One of our urgent priorities is to restore HKSAR's constitutional order and political system from chaos,"" Lam said.			
Lam said it is the constitutional responsibility of the HKSAR to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.			
Stressing the rule of law as a core value and the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success, Lam criticized violent acts and ""justice lawbreaking"" advocated by some people during the social unrest over the past year, which severely damaged social order and the rule of law and posed threats to people's lives and properties.			
Lam vowed stringent law enforcement actions to turn around this situation and noted that no one has any privileges under the law. Enditem"

	71 pct of existing green bond issuers plan more deals in Hong Kong: report		
	11/24/2020 23:20		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- Recognizing Hong Kong's advantages in green bond deals, 71 percent of existing issuers and 100 percent of existing investors in the market have plans for future green bond deals, a report said Tuesday.		
Existing issuers consider the broad scale of international investors, availability of government subsidies, and low legal and marketing expenses as important advantages of the Hong Kong market, the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary and Financial Research (HKIMR) said in its report.			
Meanwhile, some surveyed investors said they were motivated by the presence of socially responsible issuers and transparent information disclosure of Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) in Hong Kong, according to the report.			
Green bond is a type of debt issued by public or private institutions which use the funds for environmental purposes.			
With its first green bond issued in 2015, Hong Kong has become one of the major green bond hubs globally. By the end of 2019, green bonds arranged and issued here had totaled 26 billion U.S. dollars.			
Over the years, regulators and policymakers have been actively promoting the development of the local green bond market, as multiple incentive policies have been launched to attract market participants to join the great green wave, Edmond Lau, senior executive director of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said.			
Mainland entities were the largest issuer, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total market in Hong Kong, the report showed. Financial institutions and corporate issuers contributed around 50 percent and 35 percent respectively.			
In addition, the report advised Hong Kong to further improve the transparency of ESG information disclosure, promote convergence towards international green bond practices, and broaden incentive policies in a bid to perfect the infrastructure and encourage participation in the market.

HONG KONG, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong on Tuesday announced a further tightening of social distancing measures as new COVID-19 infections again hit a new high in more than three months.			
Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection reported 80 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, refreshing the record in more than three months. The origins of 10 cases were unclear out of the 69 local infections, and patients related to a dancing cluster climbed to 187.			
A series of entertainment venues from bars to party rooms and night clubs will be closed for seven days starting Thursday and the number of attendees of a banquet will be limited to 40, Sophia Chan, Secretary for Food and Health of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, said Tuesday at a press conference.			
Live performance and dancing will be banned in all eateries and the number of occupants in a hotel room will also be capped, Chan said.			
The tougher policies came after unprotected, indoor activities had boosted local infections with an increasing number of patients of unknown sources.			
To stop the coronavirus spread, the government has launched compulsory testing for people who visited high-risk places. Chan said 50 preliminary cases have been found out of some 2,800 people taking the tests.			
According to Hong Kong's Hospital Authority, 290 patients are still being treated in hospitals, including seven in critical condition.			
To relieve the pressure on public hospitals, the community treatment facility at the AsiaWorld-Expo will resume operation on Wednesday, mainly to admit patients who are relatively young, with mild symptoms and are able to live independently, as well as those tested positive preliminarily.

	HKSAR gov't refutes groundless remarks in British report on Hong Kong		
	11/24/2020 17:30		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Tuesday objected to sweeping attacks and groundless accusations by Britain in a six-monthly report on Hong Kong.		
In recent years, social unrest that featured advocating ""Hong Kong independence"" and ""self-determination,"" posed challenges to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and acts and activities undermining social order and endangering Hong Kong's stability were on the rise, especially those in the latter part of 2019, the government said in a statement.			
Hong Kong, which used to be one of the safest places in the world, was besieged by escalating violence, the government said.			
At the same time, external forces had intensified their interference and flagrantly glorified the illegal acts of radicals using the excuse of freedom and democracy, the government said, condemning overseas politicians for turning a blind eye to such violence, which seriously jeopardized China's sovereignty, security and development interests, as well as the HKSAR's prosperity and stability.			
Under the background, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) adopted the national security law in the HKSAR on June 30, which received support by some 2.9 million Hong Kong residents.			
The government said violence has significantly subsided and Hong Kong people could once again enjoy their basic rights and freedoms since the implementation of the law.			
National security is within the purview of the central authorities and the related legislation is invariably carried out by the central authorities rather than local governments, whether it is a unitary or federal state, the government said.			
Contrary to what the British report alleged, the national security law does not conflict with Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, the government said, noting that the HKSAR is still required to enact the national security legislation on its own at an early date as stipulated in the Basic Law.			
Out of respect for Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, except in limited, specified circumstances, the HKSAR has jurisdiction over cases concerning offenses under the national security law -- investigation and enforcement by the Hong Kong Police Force, prosecution by the Department of Justice, trial by Hong Kong's independent judiciary and execution of penalty by the relevant HKSAR agencies, the government said.			
The government said it doubted such responsibilities would be delegated to a local government in Britain.			
The criticism that Britain made in the report against the HKSAR government's decision to postpone the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) Election by one year smacked of double standards, the government said.			
Britain postponed the local elections in England for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak. In Hong Kong, the decision of postponement was also made against the public health risk arising from over 3 million voters coming out to cast their vote on a day involving over 600 polling stations, the government said.			
The report's concern about the disqualification of LegCo candidates and incumbent members ignored the constitutional and legal requirement for people in public office, notably legislators, to uphold the oath they made in swearing allegiance to the HKSAR and upholding the Basic Law, the government said.			
Swearing allegiance to the system of the country and upholding laws of the state is an international norm for public officers and any breach of the oath will not be tolerated, the government said.			
It is time for Britain to respect law-abiding Hong Kong people's aspirations for stability and prosperity and appreciate Hong Kong's well-positioned status to flourish under the ""one country, two systems"" with the full and unreserved support of the Chinese central government, the HKSAR government said.

	The government said it doubted such responsibilities would be delegated to a local government in Britain.		
	The criticism that Britain made in the report against the HKSAR government's decision to postpone the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) Election by one year smacked of double standards, the government said.		
	Britain postponed the local elections in England for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak. In Hong Kong, the decision of postponement was also made against the public health risk arising from over 3 million voters coming out to cast their vote on a day involving over 600 polling stations, the government said.		
	The report's concern about the disqualification of LegCo candidates and incumbent members ignored the constitutional and legal requirement for people in public office, notably legislators, to uphold the oath they made in swearing allegiance to the HKSAR and upholding the Basic Law, the government said.		
	Swearing allegiance to the system of the country and upholding laws of the state is an international norm for public officers and any breach of the oath will not be tolerated, the government said.		
	It is time for Britain to respect law-abiding Hong Kong people's aspirations for stability and prosperity and appreciate Hong Kong's well-positioned status to flourish under the "one country, two systems" with the full and unreserved support of the Chinese central government, the HKSAR government said.

	Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HKSAR advises Britain to stop colonial dreams of interfering in Hong Kong affairs		
	11/24/2020 2:24		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Monday expressed strong indignation and firm opposition in response to a British government report meddling in Hong Kong affairs.		
The spokesperson said the so-called Six-monthly Report on Hong Kong ignored the fact that Hong Kong has already returned to China, slandered and smeared the Central Government's policy towards Hong Kong, grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, openly trampled on the principles of international law and the basic norms of international relations.			
The spokesperson said that the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR has received extensive support from Hong Kong people and righteous people in the international community. The law has established and improved the HKSAR legal system and its enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, effectively reversed last year's violence and chaos. It has also ensured the full and accurate implementation of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong.			
Britain, which has a strict national security law of its own, has wantonly attacked and went all out to interfere with the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong. It unreasonably accused the Hong Kong police of enforcing law, but harbored and connive anti-China troublemakers who broke the law and committed crimes.			
The spokesperson said that the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualifications of the HKSAR's Legislative Council (LegCo) members has clearly defined the legal consequences and disqualification procedures for LegCo members who do not comply with their words and deeds of ""upholding the HKSAR Basic Law"" and ""being loyal to the HKSAR"", which is constitutional, legal and reasonable.			
The decision has ensured that ""those who are patriotic and love Hong Kong govern Hong Kong and those who oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong should be out."" It is conducive to the smooth operation of the HKSAR LegCo and the building of consensus in the development of Hong Kong society.			
Politicians being loyal to their country is not unique to China, but is a recognized international practice. Britain has its own system of oath of allegiance, but it distorted the actions taken by the Central Government and the HKSAR government to put things right. What is Britain's intention to blatantly voice grievances for anti-China troublemakers?			
The spokesperson said that while Britain accused China of undermining ""one country, two systems,"" it broke its promise by promoting British National Overseas (BNO) Passport visa policy, unilaterally suspended its agreement with the HKSAR for the surrender of fugitive offenders, wantonly undermined the normal economic cooperation and trade exchange between both sides, and interfered in the judicial and legal affairs of the HKSAR. It has been clear that who is undermining ""one country, two systems.""			
The spokesperson reiterated that it has been 23 years since Hong Kong's return to its motherland. The provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration concerning the British side have all been fulfilled. However, Britain concocted the so-called report, criticizing Hong Kong affairs, which is totally against the historical trend.

	HKSAR officials call for vigilance as new COVID-19 infections hit new high

	HONG KONG, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday reached a new high in over three months, prompting the HKSAR government to roll out more stringent measures to curb further spreading of the virus.		
The Center for Health Protection said there were 68 new cases, including 61 local infections reported, taking Hong Kong's total tally to 5,628. Twelve of the local cases had unknown origins and most of the rest cases were related to dancing club clusters.			
The Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said a compulsory testing order was issued to those who have been to the 14 places whereby the dancing gatherings have taken place, as the number of unlinked cases has been increasing in the past few days.			
To reduce the risk of transmission, face-to-face classes for low-grades primary school students and in kindergartens have been suspended; special groups such as patients with symptoms, care home staffs and taxi drivers have been given compulsory testing; and more sampling stations have been set up.			
Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR government Matthew Cheung Kin-chung called on the public to strengthen self-discipline and self-protection, reduce unnecessary trips and gatherings, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene, and strictly observe epidemic prevention regulations and restrictions.			
The HKSAR government is closely monitoring the development of the epidemic, and will probably introduce more stringent anti-epidemic measures to contain the virus, so as to resume customs clearance between the mainland, Macao and Hong Kong at an early date and restart Hong Kong's economy, he said.

	Taiwan's manufacturing output sees seventh quarterly decline		
	11/22/2020 15:36		
	TAIPEI, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The production value of Taiwan's manufacturing industries totaled 3.2 trillion new Taiwan dollars (about 112 billion U.S. dollars) in the third quarter of this year, down 4.56 percent year on year, according to the island's economic affairs department.		
The production value of manufacturing industries in the island saw a year-on-year decline over the past seven consecutive quarters, said the department in a statement earlier this week.			
Although the reduction has slowed down compared with the second quarter, Taiwan's manufacturing industries have struggled through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly traditional manufacturers, the statement said.			
Taiwan's traditional industrial products, such as petroleum, coal, chemicals, basic metals and machinery, have faced shrinking demands and price reduction in the international market, it added.			
In the third quarter, the petroleum and coal industry's production value declined 40.31 percent year on year, while the figure for the chemical raw material industry edged down 21.53 percent and that for basic metals slipped 16.28 percent.			
However, IT industries have performed well in the third quarter. The integrated circuit sector's production value increased 15.1 percent year on year and that of the electronic component industry edged up 8.79 percent.			
IT industries are expected to continue growth momentum in the fourth quarter thanks to the upcoming shopping season in the overseas market and the marketing of the latest consumer electronic products.

	Cross-Strait investment up in first 10 months		
	11/22/2020 1:27		
	TAIPEI, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- The total cross-Strait investment by mainland and Taiwan enterprises rose significantly in the first 10 months of this year, according to the island's economic affairs department.		
From January to October, investment in the mainland by Taiwan enterprises increased by 47 percent year on year to 4.71 billion U.S. dollars, the department said in a press release earlier this week.			
In October alone, the authority approved investment projects involving 490 million U.S. dollars, up 29 percent year on year.

HONG KONG, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong on Saturday reported the highest number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in about three months, with the authorities toughening up measures to fend off a new wave of the coronavirus outbreak.			
The Center for Health Protection (CHP) said there were seven new imported cases and 36 local infections detected on Saturday, including 13 with unknown origins.			
Meanwhile, over 60 people tested positive for COVID-19 primarily.			
Head of the CHP's Communicable Disease Branch Chuang Shuk-kwan said the new cases have been rising rapidly in recent days, and warned of a fourth wave of the epidemic outbreak.			
In the face of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has tightened social distancing measures including banning live performance in bars and nightclubs and suspending in-person learning for grade 1-3 primary school students.			
To reduce imported cases, the government also raised the threshold for the crew members of flights to obtain exemption of quarantine. Among the new requirements starting Sunday is that they must have a negative testing result within 48 hours and take another test after arriving in Hong Kong.			
Data showed crew members of flights accounted for about 93 percent of all the visitors exempted from quarantine in Hong Kong every day.			
The exemption policy for other visitors including sailors of cargo ships was also tightened.			
HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said in a social media post that the situation was ""fairly severe"" and pledged more testings to cut transmission chains.			
Due to the worsening epidemic, the bilateral Air Travel Bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore due to start on Sunday will be postponed for two weeks and the launch time will be subject to the situation of the epidemic. Enditem

HONG KONG, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- Ellen Tsang, chairwoman of the Y.Elites Association, has encouraged Hong Kong young people to seize the opportunities created in national development, in particular those brought by the 14th Five-Year Plan.			
In an interview with Xinhua, Tsang cited opportunities in building Hong Kong into a global innovation and technology center, constructing the Belt and Road platform and developing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.			
The high-quality development of the Greater Bay Area will greatly broaden the development room of Hong Kong youth and give them a huge stage to give full play to their expertise and skills,"" Tsang said.			
Participating in the Belt and Road construction, young people familiar with both Eastern and Western cultures can help bridge China and the rest of the world during the country's further opening-up, and the innovation drive, including upgrades in traditional sectors, will also enable young people to stretch their wings, she said.			
Tsang called on young people to tap on the chances in Hong Kong's integration into the country's new ""dual circulation"" development pattern.			
To motivate Hong Kong youth, Tsang stressed efforts to promote exchange activities between Hong Kong and other parts of the Greater Bay Area and improve the understanding of the significance of ""one country, two systems"" to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.

	Liaison office of central gov't in HKSAR voices support for investigating violations of national security law on CUHK campus		
	11/20/2020 23:17		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday expressed firm support for the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police in investigating and dealing with suspected violations of the national security law in Hong Kong at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).		
A spokesperson of the liaison office said that some people, on the pretext that they were dissatisfied that the CUHK moved the graduation ceremony online in response to epidemic prevention needs, initiated a rally of nearly 100 people on campus without applying on Thursday, during which a few people defaced and damaged properties and were suspected of criminal damage. Some even shouted and displayed ""Hong Kong independence"" slogans.			
In response, the university promptly called the police and issued two statements of condemnation. The education department of the HKSAR government and the police both pointed out that the relevant activities were suspected of violating the national security law in Hong Kong. The department for safeguarding national security of the Hong Kong Police Force has launched an investigation.			
We firmly support the related national security agencies in the HKSAR to take decisive measures to quickly investigate and deal with the case in accordance with the law,"" the spokesperson said.			
For the more than 10,000 fresh graduates of the CUHK, the graduation ceremony is a solemn and sacred moment in their lives. However, the violent actions of the people involved in the disturbance not only violated the government's restriction on gathering, tarnished the beautiful campus, but also seriously desecrated the feelings of the vast majority of graduates and their relatives and friends. More seriously, those people openly incited antagonism and advocated ""Hong Kong independence"" and have been suspected of violating the national security law in Hong Kong. The spokesperson expressed strong condemnation.			
University campus should be a place for cultivating talents and learning and should not be a place for illegal activities, the spokesperson stressed. After the promulgation and implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong, the year-long turmoil and threats to the safety of Hong Kong residents have been initially contained, and peace has just returned to campus.			
At present, the general public are looking forward to concentrating on stabilizing the epidemic situation, recovering the economy and relieving the hardship of the people. At this time, it is extremely unpopular for a very small number of people to bewitch some students to make trouble for their own sinister political schemes, the spokesperson said. Enditem"

Meanwhile, exports of goods soared by 252.2 percent year-on-year, the DSEC report added.			
Domestic demand saw a smaller decrease of 6.1 percent year-on-year, on account of a slower rate of decline in private consumption expenditure. Imports of goods increased by 17.6 percent while imports of services slid by 44.1 percent.

	MACAO, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao's composite consumer price index (CPI) for October fell by 0.75 percent year-on-year to 101.91, the special administrative region's statistic department said here on Friday.

The price indices of communication, and recreation and culture dropped by 13.46 percent and 9.27 percent year-on-year respectively, whereas the indices of health, and household furnishings and services rose by 2.81 percent and 2.24 percent.			
The composite CPI for October edged down by 0.06 percent month-to-month. The price indices of communication and transport dropped by 2.50 percent and 0.65 percent respectively on account of receding charges for communication services and lower airfares.

	HONG KONG, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) - Face-to-face classes for grade 1-3 primary school students will be suspended from Nov. 23 to Dec. 6 as the COVID-19 situation in Hong Kong has worsened rapidly, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said.		
Hong Kong reported another 26 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Friday, including 21 local infections, and more than 30 preliminary confirmed cases, said Sophia Chan, secretary for food and health of the HKSAR government.			
The outbreaks of upper respiratory tract infections have been reported in quite many primary schools and kindergartens over the recent weeks. Chan pointed out that the transmission routes of upper respiratory tract infections and COVID-19 are similar, and if COVID-19 spreads at schools, the risk posed to the community is very high.			
If the situation worsens, face-to-face classes for other grades will also be suspended, she added, appealing to the public to be extra vigilant against the virus and avoid unnecessary gatherings.			
Chan said people having symptoms, taxi drivers and care home workers will be arranged to take compulsory tests as soon as possible. The government is also adding mobile sampling kiosks and dispatching more sampling bottles to residents in buildings and communities with relatively more confirmed cases. Enditem"

	HKSAR gov't strongly condemns joint statement by foreign ministers of 5 countries about Chinese top legislature's decision		
	11/20/2020 0:54		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government strongly condemned the joint statement by foreign ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States in which deliberate misrepresentation was made regarding a recent decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of members of the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo).		
These comments, irresponsible to the point of malice, are proof of blatant interference in Hong Kong matters which are squarely internal affairs of China, a spokesman of the HKSAR government said Thursday.			
Swearing allegiance to the system of the country and upholding laws of the state is an international norm for public officers and any breach of the oath will not be tolerated, the spokesman said.			
By publicly criticizing the resolute action of the central government and the HKSAR government to disqualify four LegCo members who have been confirmed in accordance with the law to have breached their oath, the five foreign ministers are clearly applying double standards, the spokesman said.			
Four members of the sixth-term LegCo, namely Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki, Dennis Kwok and Kenneth Leung, submitted nomination to run for the 2020 LegCo General Election that was originally scheduled for Sept. 6. Their nominations were invalidated by Returning Officers (ROs) before the end of the nomination period, and they hence lost the qualification for running for the election of the seventh-term LegCo.			
The ROs ruled that the behavior of these four persons was not in compliance with the declaration requirement of the Legislative Council Ordinance to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to China's HKSAR.			
This is obviously sensible and logical, the spokesman said, stressing that if they are found to be unfit to stand for election to LegCo, it must follow that they are also unfit to continue to discharge their duties as members of the LegCo.			
As the issue involves the decision of the Standing Committee of the NPC made on Aug. 11 and its Interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law, the HKSAR government could not decide on the qualification of the four members on its own and therefore requested the central government to invite the Standing Committee of the NPC to resolve the problem from a constitutional perspective, the spokesman said.			
The decision made by the Standing Committee of the NPC on Nov. 11 is constitutional, lawful and necessary. It ensures the faithful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and safeguards the constitutional order of the HKSAR, the spokesman said, adding that there is no question of ""destroying 'one country, two systems' or a high degree of autonomy"" as claimed by a few.			
The decision does not affect the rights and freedom, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, enjoyed by Hong Kong residents, the spokesman said, stressing that the HKSAR government denounced any such irresponsible remarks by foreign political figures.			
The HKSAR government solemnly reminded the international community that foreign governments should stop their scaremongering and interfering in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR and urged them to respect the importance attached to peace, stability and prosperity by the Hong Kong people under the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" the spokesman said.

	Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HKSAR condemns "Five Eyes" for groundless accusations against Chinese top legislature's decision		
	11/19/2020 18:44		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- The office of the commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday strongly condemned "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance for groundless accusations against the decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) members.		
A spokesperson of the office said the alliance's statement concerning Hong Kong is an arbitrary interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs.			
It is a universal principle of political ethics that holders of public office, lawmakers vested with legislative power in particular, shall uphold constitutional laws and pledge allegiance to their home countries, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson added that it is also a common practice worldwide to require an oath of allegiance, set out the qualifications of lawmakers and ensure their national identity and political loyalty through legislation.			
The spokesperson pointed out that as the qualification of LegCo members of the HKSAR concerns how the related decision of the Standing Committee of the NPC, Article 104 of the Basic Law and the interpretation of it, and the national security law in the HKSAR shall be understood and implemented.			
As the HKSAR government could not decide on its own, it is reasonable, legitimate and constitutional that the Standing Committee of the NPC, the Chinese top legislature, deals with such constitutional issues at the central level with indisputable authority, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson emphasized that the decision is a necessary step to uphold and improve ""one country, two systems"" and implement the Basic Law and the national security law in the HKSAR, and a just effort to maintain the rule of law and constitutional order.			
Instead of eroding the high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR, the decision will only protect it under the premise of ""one country"" and Hong Kong people with patriots as the mainstay governing Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.			
Instead of undermining Hong Kong's democracy and its people's rights and freedoms, the decision will only keep anti-China troublemakers in check in Hong Kong and better safeguard the lawful rights and interests and well-being of the majority of Hong Kong people, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson said no one is more earnest and determined than the Chinese government to fully and faithfully implement ""one country, two systems"", or more concerned about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and its people's rights and well-being, stressing that Hong Kong's international rankings for freedoms, the judicial system and the rule of law have all surged since its return to the motherland, and its people are enjoying unprecedented rights and freedoms under the law.			
The spokesperson emphasized that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is essentially about China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and arrangements for the transitional period, and no single word or clause in the document, which has altogether eight paragraphs and three annexes, grants Britain any responsibility to Hong Kong after its return, still less any right to meddle with Hong Kong affairs.			
Britain has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or the right to supervise Hong Kong, and likewise other countries are in no position to make unwarranted comments about Hong Kong affairs on the pretext of the Joint Declaration, the spokesperson said, noting that the allegation that China has breached international commitments is simply unjustifiable.			
The spokesperson said that peace, development and win-win cooperation are the trend of the times and the right way forward, and urged the relevant countries to immediately stop applying double standards, provoking ideological clashes, or forming small circles with a Cold War mentality.			
China is rock-firm in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and any foreign pressure or coercion in a bid to force China to tolerate damage to its national sovereignty, security and development interests is doomed to be futile and self-defeating, the spokesperson said.

	Taiwan denies CTi News application to renew license		
	11/19/2020 1:32		
	TAIPEI, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's telecom and broadcasting service regulator on Wednesday denied an application from CTi News to renew its license, effectively shutting down the cable news channel.		
CTi News' current broadcast license is valid until Dec. 11, and the license renewal rejection will force the channel to cease operations by that date. TV channels in Taiwan are required to renew their licenses every six years.			
The regulatory agency claimed that CTi News had repeatedly violated regulations, received an increasing number of complaints from viewers, and failed to exercise professionalism and impose an effective internal control mechanism.			
However, the decision has been viewed by the public and many insiders to be politically motivated, as CTi News has clearly spoken out against ""Taiwan independence"" and stood on the front line in overseeing Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority.			
CTi News said in a statement on Wednesday that the decision was ""a political verdict"" and that it will use all legal means to ""fight until the end."" Enditem"

(Xinhua/Wu Xiaochu)		
HONG KONG, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong should actively adjust its role and seek a new orientation for development, participants at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Conference said here on Wednesday.			
To prepare the way forward for Hong Kong in the Greater Bay Area, three parts to this preparation should be done, including policy research, public messaging and community engagement, said Leung Chun-ying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).			
Hong Kong should enhance international cooperation and build itself into a global center for innovation and technology, and on the other hand, it should strengthen cooperation with the mainland enterprises and reinforce synchronization on funds and technology with the mainland, he said.			
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said the Greater Bay Area will enrich the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.			
The HKSAR government will give priorities to innovation and technology, and support young people, she said.			
The conference, organized by China Daily, an English newspaper, and the Silk Road Economic Development Research Center, attracted over 400 people, including government officials, business leaders and academics both online and offline to share their views on Hong Kong's future.			
Annie Wu Suk-ching, honorary chairwoman of Beijing Air Catering, said the Greater Bay Area is a hot spot for young people in Hong Kong to seek new opportunities and make more contributions to the country.			
Hong Kong should seize the opportunity to cultivate fintech and provide convenience for technology companies in the financial market, such as developing financial products and introducing international investment to fintech companies, Hong Kong's former secretary for financial services and the treasury Chan Ka-keung said.			
Witman Hung, principal liaison officer for Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Qianhai Authority, said Hong Kong should integrate its economy into the country's new ""dual circulation"" development pattern, strengthen ties with the mainland, cooperate with the Greater Bay Area cities including Shenzhen, and serve the country's great development together.

	Legal forum held in Hong Kong to mark 30th anniversary of promulgation of Basic Law

	HONG KONG, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- A legal summit was held Tuesday here to mark the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.		
During the forum themed ""Back to Basics"", officials and legal experts highlighted the significance of respecting the authority of the Constitution and the Basic Law in Hong Kong's legal system and agreed that ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" is crucial to safeguarding the constitutional order of ""one country, two systems"".			
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said in her speech that only by correctly understanding the relationship between ""one country"" and ""two systems"" and always acting in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, will the steady and sustained development of ""one country, two systems"" be ensured.			
Lam said that the issue of sovereignty cannot be discussed and the advocation of ""Hong Kong independence"" cannot be tolerated.			
When implementing the Basic Law, the principle of ""one country"" should be adhered to, and the relationship between the HKSAR and the central authorities should be properly handled, Lam said.			
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) has the power of interpretation of the Basic Law and the power of supervision over the law's implementation, as well as the power of resolving constitutional issues during the implementation of the Basic Law, Lam said.			
To fulfill her responsibility, Lam twice requested the central government to submit issues to the Standing Committee of the NPC for solutions at the constitutional level. The practice is in line with the Constitution and the Basic Law, and no slander and smear by any foreign governments or political organizations are allowed, Lam said.			
In his speech, Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the promulgation of the national security law in the HKSAR has ushered in a new era by turning chaos into social stability.			
Those who are patriotic and love Hong Kong govern Hong Kong, while those who oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong should be out, which, as a political rule under ""one country, two systems"", has now become a legal norm, he said.			
Zhang said that it is an urgent matter to right the wrongs in people's minds and ""patriotism"" should be put before the core values of democracy, freedom and human rights that Hong Kong society upholds.			
Recently the Hong Kong society has had heated discussions on the issue of judicial reform, he said, adding that reasonable voices calling for the reform should be paid high attention to by the legal field.			
Also addressing the meeting, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Chen Dong said the Constitution and the Basic Law have determined the constitutional order of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong. To safeguard Hong Kong's rule of law, the authority of the Constitution and the Basic Law in Hong Kong's legal system must be respected, he added.			
Chen highlighted the implementation of ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" and said public officers in executive, legislative and judicial organs must genuinely uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the HKSAR.			
Zhang Yong, deputy head of the Commission for Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing Committee, said there are two principles of building the system of the HKSAR by the Basic Law, which are ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" with patriots as the main body and a high degree of autonomy entrusted by the central authorities.			
Only after the HKSAR genuinely implements the Basic Law and the central authorities effectively exercise supervision according to the Constitution, will the high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR and the overall jurisdiction of the central authorities be effectively combined, and will the steady and sustained development of ""one country, two systems"" be ensured, Zhang Yong said.			
During the meeting, attendees also discussed the drafting procedures, the original purpose and mission and the interpretation practice of the Basic Law, the responsibilities of safeguarding national security under ""one country, two systems"", and the benefits to the HKSAR of implementing ""one country, two systems"" according to the Basic Law.			
Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Leung Chun-ying, Carrie Lam, Chen Dong, Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Xie Feng, deputy director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Li Jiangzhou, Geoffrey Ma Tao-li, chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR, and President of the HKSAR Legislative Council Andrew Leung attended the forum in person.

	HONG KONG, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock Connect, a landmark mutual market access program connecting Hong Kong and mainland equity markets, celebrated on Tuesday its sixth anniversary with record trading.		
Since its launch, Stock Connect has seen sustained volume growth in both northbound and southbound trading, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) said in a statement, adding that total value of shares held through the program is at an all-time record and there has been growing participation from both mainland and international investors.			
The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched on November 17, 2014, while Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched two years later on December 5, 2016, giving mainland and international investors direct access to each other's market from their home market.			
Hong Kong and international investors held a total of 2.1 trillion yuan (about 320 billion U.S. dollars) worth of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange A-shares as at November 10, 2020, compared with 86.5 billion yuan at the end of 2014, shortly after the launch of Stock Connect.			
Mainland investors held 1.88 trillion billion Hong Kong dollars (about 240 billion U.S. dollars) worth of Hong Kong-listed shares through Stock Connect as at November 10, 2020, up from 13.1 billion Hong Kong dollars at the end of 2014.			
As at November 10, 2020, the total turnover of northbound trading reached 36.9 trillion yuan, with a net inflow of 1.12 trillion yuan, while 13.7 trillion Hong Kong dollars of shares were traded on the southbound leg, with a net inflow of 1.62 trillion Hong Kong dollars.			
The daily trade value of Stock Connect hit new records in 2020 -- 191.16 billion yuan for northbound trading on July 7 and 60.17 billion Hong Kong dollars for southbound trading on July 6.			
As Stock Connect continues to gain momentum, more international investors are enjoying faster access to the mainland's A-shares market and mainland investors are contributing to Hong Kong's growing market liquidity, the HKEX said.			
The HKEX said enhancements to the Stock Connect program are ongoing, such as the broadening of its investment scope. It promised to work with mainland partners and regulators to bring more opportunities to investors and companies. (1 U.S. dollar equals 7.75 HK dollars, or 6.57 yuan) Enditem"

	Hong Kong to tighten testing, isolation arrangements for inbound consular, diplomatic officers		
	11/18/2020 0:01		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government announced Tuesday that the testing and isolation arrangements for consular and diplomatic officers who are currently exempted from quarantine upon arriving in Hong Kong will be tightened with effect from Wednesday.		
A government spokesman said in a statement that the decision was made in view of the development and severity of the global epidemic situation and those from places deemed as very high risks before entering Hong Kong will in particular be affected.			
Those who have visited very high risk places during the past 14 days must have a negative testing result within 48 hours prior to boarding the flight to Hong Kong and take a post-arrival test at the specimen collection center of the Department of Health of the HKSAR government.			
Except for Consul Generals or representatives in the HKSAR at the equivalent level, all others must be subject to self-isolation for 14 days. The use of public transport is also prohibited for them.			
Those who have not visited very high risk places will face basically the same arrangements except self-isolation.			
The spokesman said the tightening is needed to strengthen the prevention of imported cases and avoid exempted people's contact with the local community during the exemption period so as to achieve the strategic goal of ""controlling the epidemic with precision."" Enditem"

	Patriots governing Hong Kong now a legal norm: Chinese government official

	HONG KONG, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Those who are patriotic and love Hong Kong govern Hong Kong, while those who oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong should be out. This, as a political rule under the "one country, two systems", has now become a legal norm, a senior Chinese government official said on Tuesday.		
The promulgation of the national security law in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has ushered in a new era by turning chaos into social stability, said Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a legal summit on the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law via video link.			
Zhang said that, to comprehensively and accurately understand and implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"", one should see that ""one country"" is the premise and foundation for implementing ""two systems""; that the socialist system with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the support and guarantee for Hong Kong's capitalist system to remain unchanged for a long time to come; that safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests is the primary purpose of ""one country, two systems""; that the central government's overall jurisdiction is the source of a high degree of autonomy; that after Hong Kong's return, its legal system, including the common law system, has been incorporated into the constitutional order established on the basis of the National Constitution and the Basic Law; that Hong Kong's development			
Zhang pointed out that improving the principle of ""one country, two systems"" is a realistic need. The Basic Law of the HKSAR is the legalization and institutionalization of the principle of ""one country, two systems"". The Basic Law should be regarded as a ""living law"" and its adaptability should be enlarged through legislative interpretation and other means. It is also necessary to continuously improve the institutional system related to the implementation of the Basic Law through various means.			
Zhang said he is glad to see that the relevant departments of the HKSAR government are working on improving the civil service oath system, the education system, the qualification examination system for Legislative Council members and other relevant systems. Recently, the Hong Kong society has had heated discussions on the issue of judicial reform. Even in Western countries, the judicial system is constantly reforming with the times, which does not affect judicial independence.			
Zhang stressed that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. It's perfectly justified to require those who govern Hong Kong to be patriots. The personnel of the HKSAR government institutions must sincerely uphold the Basic Law, bear allegiance to the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR, and refrain from doing anything that undermines the interests of the state and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. The recent decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the qualification of LegCo members of the HKSAR not only provides a solid legal basis for the HKSAR government to immediately disqualify four opposition lawmakers, but also sets clear rules for handling such issues in the future, he added.			
The world is changing, China is changing and Hong Kong is also changing. Hong Kong has undergone both passive and active changes, including putting things right politically and solving difficult problems through courageous reforms in the field of economy and people's livelihood. During the process, there will be ""pains"" inevitably, but the general trend is that the situation is to become better and better, Zhang said. Enditem"

One country, two systems,"" taking account of history and realities of Hong Kong, is designed to preserve the characteristics and strengths of Hong Kong as much as possible and to enable Hong Kong residents to maintain their way of life on the prerequisite of upholding national unity and territorial integrity and maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, Lam said when addressing the forum themed ""Back to Basics.""			
The original purpose and mission of ""one country, two systems"" have never changed and have been the fundamental spirit of various policies by the central authorities for the HKSAR, Lam said, stressing that the issue of sovereignty cannot be discussed and advocating of ""Hong Kong independence"" cannot be tolerated.			
When implementing the Basic Law, ""one country"" should be adhered to and the relationship between the HKSAR and the central authorities should be properly handled, Lam said, noting that the central authorities' power and a high degree of autonomy of Hong Kong should be both ensured.			
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) has the power of interpretation of the Basic Law and the power of supervision over the law's implementation, as well as the power of resolving issues concerning the Constitution during the implementation, Lam said.			
Lam cited the two issues concerning the Constitution that the HKSAR was unable to address during the past months, which involved the vacancy of the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) due to the election postponement and the qualification of four LegCo members who were ruled by Returning Officers as not upholding the Basic Law and swearing allegiance to the HKSAR.			
To fulfill her responsibility, Lam twice requested the central government to submit the issues to the Standing Committee of the NPC for solutions at the constitutional level.			
The practice is in line with the Constitution and the Basic Law and no slanders and smears by foreign governments or political organizations are allowed, Lam said. Enditem"

	MACAO, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Ho Iat Seng delivered the policy address for the fiscal year 2021 on Monday afternoon, focusing on anti-pandemic measures and economic recovery.		
Ho gave his second policy address at the Legislative Assembly, titled ""Strengthening the foundation for consolidation, tackling challenges head on.""			
Ho said thanks to the support and guidance of the central government, the support and cooperation of various mainland areas and the joint efforts of all Macao residents, Macao has achieved zero deaths, zero community infections, zero nosocomial infections with low severe cases and high cure rates in the COVID-19 pandemic.			
Macao is now a safe tourist destination with low risk of epidemic situation, and mainland authorities have resumed the issuance of travel permit for mainland residents as tourists to Macao, the chief executive added.			
Ho said that the SAR government will have eight main tasks in 2021, including epidemic prevention and control, economic recovery, people's livelihood and welfare, moderately diversified and sustainable economic development, public administration reform, cultural and educational development, safeguarding national security, and deepening of regional cooperation.			
Ho reiterated that in 2021 the SAR government will stick to the epidemic prevention strategy of ""preventing imports and local resurgence,"" including improving the import and export health and quarantine mechanism, and monitoring the import of cold-chain food to prevent the COVID-19 infection.			
In terms of economic recovery, the chief executive said China has been forming a new dual circulation development pattern, where domestic and foreign markets can boost each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.			
For Macao which is in the intersection of dual circulation, this new pattern is not only an opportunity and an advantage, but also a responsibility and a duty, Ho added.			
The policy address mentioned several measures to promote a moderately diversified economy, such as industry repositioning, bond market and wealth management, industrialization of traditional Chinese medicine, cross-border e-commerce, and industrialization of the cultural and sport sectors.			
Ho also said Macao will actively follow the blueprints in the country's proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan. For example, the SAR government will work with Guangdong province and Zhuhai city to build Hengqin Guangdong-Macao Deep Cooperation Zone.			
In terms of safeguarding national security, Ho vowed that Macao will constantly improve the related legal system and enforcement mechanism, strengthen law enforcement, promote publicity and education, and enhance residents' awareness of national security.			
The chief executive said the future of Macao has always been closely linked with the mainland. With the support of the central government and the people of the motherland, and the concerted efforts of Macao residents, the SAR government is confident to face all kinds of challenges, and break new ground for the practice of ""one country, two systems"" with Macao characteristics.

	HKSAR government officials say top legislature's decision helps ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability		
	11/14/2020 21:50		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said Saturday the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) members is constitutional, lawful and reasonable.		
It will help implement ""one country, two systems,"" safeguard national security, and ensure Hong Kong's long-term peace and stability, they said.			
The HKSAR government announced recently that four sixth-term LegCo members including Dennis Kwok were disqualified by the decision adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC, China's top legislature.			
Teresa Cheng, Secretary for Justice of the HKSAR government, said in an online article that the decision has solid legal basis.			
The Standing Committee of the NPC has the duty to maintain the constitutional order of the HKSAR and to ensure that members of the LegCo, who continued to discharge their duties in the sixth-term LegCo, must be in compliance with the legal requirements and preconditions for taking up the post of a LegCo member by upholding the Basic Law and pledging allegiance to the HKSAR, Cheng said.			
Those advocating or supporting ""Hong Kong independence,"" refusing to recognize China's sovereignty over Hong Kong and the exercise of the sovereignty, soliciting intervention by foreign or external forces, or carrying out other activities endangering national security could not genuinely uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR, Cheng noted.			
They can neither fulfill the legal requirements and conditions for a LegCo member nor have the qualifications of a LegCo member, she said.			
As the nominations of the relevant LegCo members had been invalidated by Returning Officers when they applied to participate in the LegCo election of the seventh term, they are naturally unable to continue to serve as LegCo members, Cheng said.			
Secretary for Security of the HKSAR government John Lee expressed full support for the decision in an online article. He said LegCo members as public officers must genuinely uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR.			
It is the common responsibility of all the people of China, including the people of Hong Kong, to safeguard the sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity of China, Lee cited the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong.			
Any institution, organization or individual in the HKSAR shall abide by the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong and other local laws on safeguarding national security, and shall not engage in any act or activity which endangers national security, Lee added.			
The requirement of genuine oaths for public officers is recognized globally and the LegCo members must bear the consequence of violating the legal requirements of their oaths, which is also a basic norm in a society of the rule of law, Lee said.			
The NPC decision is constitutional, lawful and reasonable and is fully in line with the Basic Law, Lee said, adding that the decision will help with the implementation of ""one country, two systems,"" ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and further protect national security and the constitutional order of Hong Kong.

	HKSAR gov't condemns groundless accusations by foreign gov'ts against decision on qualification of LegCo members		
	11/14/2020 20:26		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Saturday strongly opposed and condemned groundless accusations by some foreign governments and entities against the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of members of the HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo).		
Such accusations were aimed at undermining the relationship between the central government and the HKSAR under ""one country, two systems,"" an HKSAR government spokesperson said in a statement.			
The spokesperson described the accusations as flagrant interference that breaches the basic guiding principles of international relations.			
As an inalienable part of China, the HKSAR is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy and comes directly under the central government, the spokesperson said.			
Article 104 of the HKSAR Basic Law requires designated public officers including LegCo members, when assuming office, to swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR in accordance with the law, the spokesperson said.			
Swearing allegiance to the system of the country and upholding national laws is an international norm for public officers and any breach of the oath will not be tolerated, the spokesperson said.			
Those foreign political figures who made the accusations against the central government and the HKSAR government are clearly applying double standards, the spokesperson added.			
The decision by the Standing Committee of the NPC is constitutional, lawful and necessary, which set out clearly the consequences of LegCo members violating the legal prerequisites of upholding the Basic Law of the HKSAR and swearing allegiance to the HKSAR, the spokesperson said.			
Such consequences were also applicable to LegCo members who were confirmed in accordance with the law to be ineligible to become candidates for the LegCo election, which provided the solid legal basis for the HKSAR government to announce their disqualification, the spokesperson said.			
The decision ensures the implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and safeguards the constitutional order of the HKSAR, the spokesperson said, refuting the claim that the decision destroys ""one country, two systems"" or Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.			
It is also far from the truth to accuse the decision of stifling human rights or freedoms, or undermining democracy or the legislature's checks and balance over the executive, the spokesperson said.			
The HKSAR government reiterated that Hong Kong matters are internal affairs of China and urged relevant foreign governments and individuals to adhere to the international laws and the basic guiding principles of international relations, and cease to interfere in HKSAR affairs in any manner.

	Decision on qualification of HKSAR LegCo members necessary to set things right: HKSAR chief executive

Various sectors in Hong Kong have shown their support for the decision of the NPC Standing Committee on the qualification of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Legislative Council (LegCo) members. The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following the decision adopted by China's top legislature on Wednesday. The HKSAR NPC deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) expressed firm support for the decision, saying it is reasonable, legal and constitutional and conducive to Hong Kong's well-being and rebooting its economy.

HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Various sectors in Hong Kong have shown their support for the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Legislative Council (LegCo) members.			
The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following the decision adopted by China's top legislature on Wednesday.			
The HKSAR NPC deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) expressed firm support for the decision, saying it is reasonable, legal and constitutional and conducive to Hong Kong's well-being and rebooting its economy.			
They said that the decision clearly define the bottom line of the rules so as to ensure the normal operation of Hong Kong's legislature and provide legal basis for the following work.			
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, and Tam Wai-chu, deputy director of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee, held a press conference on Thursday with more than 10 Hong Kong deputies to the NPC.			
Tam Yiu-chung said that the decision of the NPC Standing Committee has further confirmed the responsibilities of LegCo members, making it clear that LegCo members, who serve the public, must abide by Article 104 of the HKSAR Basic Law.			
The Hong Kong business community also supported the decision. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce issued a statement, saying that the decision made it clear that LegCo members must uphold and abide by the HKSAR Basic Law.			
The decision will enable the LegCo's operation to resume normal as soon as possible, which is, in the long run, conducive to the effective administration of the HKSAR government and ensure full and accurate implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and the HKSAR Basic Law, the chamber said.			
The Hong Kong Commerce and Industry Associations (HKCNIA) said that the decision has ensured the constitutional order of the HKSAR and the steady and far-reaching development of ""one country, two systems"".			
The HKCNIA has launched a joint petition inviting the public to support the HKSAR government in disqualifying LegCo members, who neglect their duties, according to law. As of 5 p.m. Thursday (local time), more than 470,000 netizens had signed the agreement.			
The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong said that the decision is constitutional and reasonable and it has provided clear guidelines for dealing with the qualifications of candidates for LegCo elections in the future.			
The association urged LegCo members to perform their duties with all their heart and discuss bills in a legal and reasonable way to ensure the effective administration of the HKSAR government.			
However, some of the lawmakers on Wednesday announced resignation in response to the decision adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC. The act was condemned by various sectors, saying those lawmakers are ignoring the well-being of Hong Kong people and challenging the central authority.			
Ng Chau-pei, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, also president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, said that the collective resignation of the opposition lawmakers has exposed their intention to perish together with Hong Kong and they are betraying voters and democratic principles.			
Chan Man-ki, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, also founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong, said that the act of collective resignation equals refusing to accept that China exercises sovereignty over Hong Kong and the central government exercises overall jurisdiction over the HKSAR.			
It is contrary to the constitutional requirement of Article 104 of the HKSAR Basic Law for the qualifications of LegCo members, said Chan.			
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) said in a statement that the decision of the NPC Standing Committee has constitutional authority and the resignation of some of the opposition LegCo members should be condemned.			
The lawmakers who decided to quit ignored the authority of the Standing Committee of the NPC and tried to destroy ""one country, two systems,"" the DAB statement said.			
Chan Chi-Ho, vice executive chairman of the Hong Kong CPPCC Youth Association, said that the collective resignation is a disgraceful behavior. Those who resigned are not loyal to the HKSAR and have shown no intention to uphold the HKSAR Basic Law. Enditem

	HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Various sectors in Hong Kong have shown their support for the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Legislative Council (LegCo) members.		
	The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following the decision adopted by China's top legislature on Wednesday.		
	The HKSAR NPC deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) expressed firm support for the decision, saying it is reasonable, legal and constitutional and conducive to Hong Kong's well-being and rebooting its economy.		
	They said that the decision clearly define the bottom line of the rules so as to ensure the normal operation of Hong Kong's legislature and provide legal basis for the following work.		
	Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, and Tam Wai-chu, deputy director of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee under the NPC Standing Committee, held a press conference on Thursday with more than 10 Hong Kong deputies to the NPC.		
	Tam Yiu-chung said that the decision of the NPC Standing Committee has further confirmed the responsibilities of LegCo members, making it clear that LegCo members, who serve the public, must abide by Article 104 of the HKSAR Basic Law.		
	The Hong Kong business community also supported the decision. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce issued a statement, saying that the decision made it clear that LegCo members must uphold and abide by the HKSAR Basic Law.		
	The decision will enable the LegCo's operation to resume normal as soon as possible, which is, in the long run, conducive to the effective administration of the HKSAR government and ensure full and accurate implementation of "one country, two systems" and the HKSAR Basic Law, the chamber said.		
	The Hong Kong Commerce and Industry Associations (HKCNIA) said that the decision has ensured the constitutional order of the HKSAR and the steady and far-reaching development of "one country, two systems".		
	The HKCNIA has launched a joint petition inviting the public to support the HKSAR government in disqualifying LegCo members, who neglect their duties, according to law. As of 5 p.m. Thursday (local time), more than 470,000 netizens had signed the agreement.		
	The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong said that the decision is constitutional and reasonable and it has provided clear guidelines for dealing with the qualifications of candidates for LegCo elections in the future.		
	The association urged LegCo members to perform their duties with all their heart and discuss bills in a legal and reasonable way to ensure the effective administration of the HKSAR government.		
	However, some of the lawmakers on Wednesday announced resignation in response to the decision adopted by the Standing Committee of the NPC. The act was condemned by various sectors, saying those lawmakers are ignoring the well-being of Hong Kong people and challenging the central authority.		
	Ng Chau-pei, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, also president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, said that the collective resignation of the opposition lawmakers has exposed their intention to perish together with Hong Kong and they are betraying voters and democratic principles.		
	Chan Man-ki, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, also founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong, said that the act of collective resignation equals refusing to accept that China exercises sovereignty over Hong Kong and the central government exercises overall jurisdiction over the HKSAR.		
	It is contrary to the constitutional requirement of Article 104 of the HKSAR Basic Law for the qualifications of LegCo members, said Chan.		
	The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) said in a statement that the decision of the NPC Standing Committee has constitutional authority and the resignation of some of the opposition LegCo members should be condemned.		
	The lawmakers who decided to quit ignored the authority of the Standing Committee of the NPC and tried to destroy "one country, two systems," the DAB statement said.		
	Chan Chi-Ho, vice executive chairman of the Hong Kong CPPCC Youth Association, said that the collective resignation is a disgraceful behavior. Those who resigned are not loyal to the HKSAR and have shown no intention to uphold the HKSAR Basic Law. Enditem

	Commissioner's Office of Chinese Foreign Ministry in HKSAR once again warns foreign politicians to stop interference		
	11/13/2020 1:46		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson of the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Thursday reiterated its strong indignation and firm opposition to a few foreign politicians' denigration of the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) concerning Hong Kong.		
The spokesperson said that the loyalty of politicians to the country is not unique to China or the HKSAR, but is a recognized international practice that is common to all countries.			
The NPC Standing Committee's decision ensures the principle that Hong Kong shall be governed by Hong Kong people with patriots as the mainstay and it is clearly applicable to the basic political ethics of all Legislative Council (LegCo) members. It has nothing to do with the political ideas of LegCo members and does not affect democracy and freedom in Hong Kong in any way.			
No country would allow people who split the country, subvert the regime and collude with external forces to hold public office. No country will allow parliamentarians to betray their vows and violate the law without bearing the legal consequences. A small number of foreign politicians confused right and wrong, which is a naked double standard, said the spokesperson.			
The spokesperson said that the NPC Standing Committee's decision aims to ensure Hong Kong's governing bodies to operate normally under ""one country, two systems"" and to better implement the principles of ""the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.			
Hong Kong's LegCo has been hijacked by anti-China activists so that it took over six months to elect a chairman of the House Committee, and bills concerning the economy and people's livelihood was stalled for a long time.			
The NPC Standing Committee's decision addresses the right problems and opens a new page for the smooth operation of the LegCo. However, in the eyes of these Western politicians, only a hijacked and paralyzed LegCo is conducive to protecting public political expression and can reflect Hong Kong's democracy and freedom, which is absolutely hypocritical, absurd and overbearing, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson stressed that the legal basis for the central government administering the HKSAR is the Constitution of China and the HKSAR Basic Law. A small number of foreign politicians use the Sino-British Joint Declaration as a pretext. However, none of the articles in the declaration gives foreign countries the right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs.			
They have no right or justification to accuse China of violating international commitments. On the contrary, they have violated international law without scruple, interfered in China's internal affairs without any bottom line, acted against the law in the international arena, ignored the rules, trampled on justice, and put domestic law above international law. They are the ones who break their promises and violate international commitments. They are the saboteurs of international law and the norms of international relations, the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson said that the NPC Standing Committee's decision, which improves ""one country, two systems"", will only promote the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR previously adopted by the NPC Standing Committee has become a major turning point from chaos to order in Hong Kong.			
The decision has further safeguarded national security and the constitutional order of the HKSAR, which is what the public has wished for. As many as some 380,000 netizens signed up to support the decision on the same day when it was announced.			
The spokesperson said that some foreign politicians can't wait to smear China and the HKSAR as soon as they see the situation in Hong Kong improving. What they care about is not the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people, but the freedom of anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong to endanger national security, the freedom to harm the interests of Hong Kong people.			
The spokesman stressed that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. Any intimidation and sanctions can not shake China's will to safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.			
More and more people in Hong Kong have recognized the plot of external interference, and more and more countries understand and support China's efforts to safeguard national security and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.			
A few foreign politicians are advised to recognize the general trend, immediately withdraw the black hand that interferes in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs in any form, and do not go further on the wrong path, the spokesperson said. Enditem"

	Commentary: Confronting central authorities' overall jurisdiction over HKSAR leads to dead end		
	11/12/2020 23:50		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- Some opposition lawmakers in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Wednesday staged a farce of the so-called "resignation en masse" following the disqualification of four members of the Legislative Council (LegCo).		
Such move is blatantly challenging the authority of the HKSAR Basic Law and the decision of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, exposing those LegCo members' true agenda of confronting the central authorities' overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong.			
The NPC Standing Committee's decision, with unchallengeable authority, provides a solid legal basis for regulating and dealing with matters concerning the qualification of LegCo members.			
It's a necessary move for the HKSAR government to maintain constitutional order in the HKSAR and fully demonstrate the impartiality and authority of the rule of law by announcing the disqualification of Dennis Kwok Wing-hang and three other LegCo members in accordance with the law.			
Law-breaking acts entail legal consequences. It is a basic norm for any society ruled by the law.			
It's natural and justified for the four LegCo members to face disqualification after they have recanted, undermined the HKSAR Basic Law, and showed disloyalty to the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China.			
However, some LegCo members from the opposition camp smeared the central government's exercise of its legitimate constitutional power as ""political suppression.""			
Their real intention is to confound the public, fiddle with ""right and wrong,"" stir up populist sentiments, create chaos, smear and slander the ""one country, two systems"" practice.			
What they are doing, like begging external forces for intervention and even sanctions, will only jeopardize the hard-earned stability in the HKSAR.			
Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China, thus staying loyal to the motherland and Hong Kong is a fundamental requirement of the Constitution and the HKSAR Basic Law.			
Such opposition figures disregard the basic requirement of being loyal to the motherland as holders of public office, or even going further to collude with external forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs.			
They have crossed the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, only to expose again their head-strong stance of confronting the central authorities and ignoring the mainstream public opinion of Hong Kong society.			
A recent survey showed that more than 60 percent of the respondents objected to the reappointment of the four disqualified LegCo members, whereas all sectors of Hong Kong society have expressed firm support for the NPC Standing Committee's decision.			
The farce by those opposition figures won't affect the operation of the LegCo. They did, however, deprive themselves of the qualification to hold public office and serve the people when Hong Kong is having a historical opportunity to turn chaos into social stability.			
To the opposition, they need to think twice on the following questions. Do they want to be a constructor or a disruptor for the ""one country, two systems"" principle and Hong Kong's development? Will they follow acceptable political norms or overstep the red line and act recklessly at the cost of the well-being of 7.5 million Hong Kong residents? Enditem"

	Hong Kong teacher deregistered for distorting historical facts		
	11/12/2020 22:12		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Education Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Thursday it has canceled the registration of a teacher, who made serious mistakes when teaching a number of historical events.		
The bureau said that the teacher taught completely wrong contents and confused right and wrong when teaching a number of historical events in the General Studies subject at a primary school. For example, when explaining the causes of Britain starting the Opium War in a web class, the teacher said that it was because Britain wanted to ""destroy opium in China"".			
The bureau described such teaching contents as obviously wrong, and even absolute nonsense.			
A spokesman for the bureau said, ""From the perspective of professional teaching, the case involved serious mistakes which reflected that the teacher not only lacked basic competence in teaching but also lacked the proper attitude expected of a teacher.""			
The bureau has gone through a thorough and stringent investigation procedure and considered the teacher not a fit and proper person to be a teacher, and thus canceled his teacher registration in accordance with the Education Ordinance of Hong Kong.			
In September, a teacher was deregistered by the bureau for systematically spreading ""Hong Kong independence"" in the classroom. Enditem"

	DPP slammed for attacking, slandering decision on Hong Kong legislators

	BEIJING, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Thursday slammed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in Taiwan for its provocative remarks over the decision of the country's top legislature on the qualification of members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of Hong Kong, saying DPP's such moves were out of its attempt to seek "Taiwan independence."		
By attacking and slandering the decision, the DPP authority once again exposed its ""despicable"" and futile attempts through its political manipulation to create chaos in Hong Kong and seek ""Taiwan independence,"" said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, when asked to comment on the provocative remarks by Taiwan's mainland affairs council on the decision.

	Central gov't office strongly condemns some HKSAR LegCo opposition lawmakers' resignation farce

	BEIJING, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese central government office spokesperson on Thursday expressed strong condemnation against the so-called "resignation en masse" by some opposition lawmakers in the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).		
The move, staged after the decision of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee on the qualification of the LegCo members, once again shows their head-strong stance to confront the central authorities, said the spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council, describing the move as a blatant challenge to the power of the central authorities and the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.			
The spokesperson said that it is a basic principle of any law-based society that holders of public office must meet the legal requirements and conditions and shoulder legal responsibilities for violation.			
The decision on the qualification of the LegCo members as well as disqualifying the four LegCo lawmakers were meant to safeguard the rule of law and the constitutional order of the HKSAR, and will benefit the orderly operation of the legislative body and social stability. The measures were supported by Hong Kong residents, said the spokesperson.			
The farce of so-called ""resignation en masse"" initiated by some opposition lawmakers, of whom 15 took part, fully exposed their nature to gain personal political interests in disregard of public interests, the spokesperson said, adding that this once again shows their head-strong stance to confront the central authorities.			
They were in fact challenging the HKSAR Basic Law and the NPC Standing Committee's relevant interpretations and decision, and confronting the central authorities' overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.

	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday strongly condemned the 15 members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) for "making a scene of resigning en masse" on the pretext of the disqualification of four LegCo members.		
The HKSAR government announced the disqualification following the decision adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of LegCo members on Wednesday.			
The liaison office said this is a just move to safeguard Hong Kong's overall and long-term interests and has won the welcome and support of the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong society.			
The opposition lawmakers' resignation en masse is an act opposing the decision of the NPC Standing Committee and ""one country, two systems,"" which is doomed to destroy their own political future but will not affect the progress of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong.			
A spokesperson of the office said opposition lawmakers have been struggling and capricious about whether to stay or not since the NPC Standing Committee decided that the 6th LegCo would continue to discharge duties for at least another year in accordance with the law.			
In August and September, they made a ""political decision"" to stay in the LegCo on the grounds of ""public support"" resulted from their ""polls."" But the high-profile declaration of ""resign en masse with no hesitation"" made by the 15 opposition lawmakers was not based on any polls.			
The spokesperson cited reports that some of them have been coerced and that the whole resignation en masse has been manipulated by someone in the dark. Their ""irresponsible remarks"" reveal that they do not take their duties as LegCo members seriously and have no political responsibility to serve the public. What they are thinking about is only their own political self-interest.			
The 15 opposition lawmakers' resignation is not only irresponsible to themselves, but also deviates from the voters who voted for them, the spokesperson said. By tying themselves up with those who do not meet the statutory conditions and requirements of LegCo members, they are also declaring themselves as being disqualified from holding public office in the HKSAR and serving the people of Hong Kong.			
They fantasize about playing the sad card by resigning, and the result will only be to create a tragedy for themselves. As for some people's delusion of creating influence in the world and winning sympathy and support, it is doomed to be futile. We will never be afraid of unreasonable interference by outside forces. As long as we do our own thing well, we will take a more steady course and Hong Kong will do even better,"" the spokesperson said.			
The spokesperson pointed out that the demand for political loyalty to politicians is not unique to the Chinese mainland or Hong Kong, but is an internationally recognized basic value. The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. Patriotism and love for Hong Kong are the political ethics that politicians in the HKSAR should have and are also the fundamental requirements of the Constitution and the basic law.			
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the central authorities have always attached great importance to strengthening ties with all sectors of Hong Kong society and advocated pooling the strength of all parties to jointly promote the cause of ""one country, two systems"" under the banner of love for country and love for Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, the opposition has always been able to become members of the LegCo and various departments of the HKSAR government through legal channels and has the opportunity to assume the responsibility of building Hong Kong rationally and pragmatically, the spokesperson added.			
In Western politics, there is a concept of ""loyal opposition"", which requires political participants with different views to be loyal to the existing constitutional system, to offer constructive criticism, but never to betray the state. This is the accepted rules of the game. However, a small number of members have broken their oath, ""not supporting"", ""not pledging allegiance"", wantonly destroying the constitutional order of the HKSAR, intending to paralyze the governance, and colluding with external forces to intervene in Hong Kong's affairs. They have crossed the political bottom line and will inevitably be abandoned by the system.			
The spokesperson stressed that the behavior of a few people will not affect the implementation of NPC Standing Committee's decision, the operation of the Legislative Council will become smooth and orderly, and the ""one country, two systems"" system will continue to progress. Enditem"

	Commissioner's Office of Chinese Foreign Ministry in HKSAR slams external interference concerning Chinese top legislature's decision		
	11/12/2020 01:11		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson of the Commissioner's Office of Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday firmly refuted and strongly condemned allegations by some Western politicians concerning the decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualifications of members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the HKSAR.		
The Decision, said the spokesperson, is a reasonable, legitimate and necessary to safeguard the enduring success of ""one country, two systems"", and no external force shall interfere.			
The spokesperson said that it is a universal principle of political ethics that holders of public office, legislators vested with legislative power in particular, shall uphold constitutional laws and pledge allegiance to their home countries. It is an international common practice to require an oath of allegiance, set out the qualifications of legislators and ensure their national identity and political loyalty through legislation. No country will ever allow holders of public office, legislators included, to breach their oath and betray their countries. And it is a basic norm in any society governed by the rule of law that lawbreakers shall be held accountable.			
The spokesperson pointed out the principle that Hong Kong shall be governed by Hong Kong people with patriots as the mainstay is an integral part of ""one country, two systems"" from the very beginning. Loving both the country and Hong Kong is a basic requirement of the Constitution and the basic law, and an ethical principle every public office holder in the HKSAR shall adhere to.			
A handful of LegCo members, however, have unscrupulously disrupted LegCo and obstructed normal operation of Hong Kong's political system and government function, in defiance of their oath of allegiance, rules and law. Moreover, they have even refused to acknowledge China's exercise of sovereignty over the HKSAR and Hong Kong's constitutional status as a local special administrative region of China, lobbied foreign countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, and willingly acted as the pawns of foreign forces. The evidence is solid and undeniable that they have pit themselves against ""one country, two systems"" and the basic law. Therefore, it is only just and necessary to disqualify such LegCo members in accordance with the law.			
The spokesperson said that it is right and proper and consistent with the Constitution that the NPC Standing Committee, as the permanent body of the highest organ of state power in China, deals with constitutional issues in the implementation of the basic law and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR. The legal effect and authority of its decisions are not to be challenged. The qualifications of LegCo members concern how the related decisions by the NPC Standing Committee, Article 104 of the basic law and the interpretation of it, and the national security law in Hong Kong shall be understood and implemented. Such issues cannot be resolved by the HKSAR government on its own, and shall be addressed at the constitutional level.			
The Decision has clarified the legal consequences of breaches by LegCo members of their pledge to uphold the basic law and allegiance to the HKSAR, and has established the procedure for disqualification. It is vital for staying committed to and improving ""one country, two systems"", for implementing the basic law and the national security law in Hong Kong, and for upholding the rule of law and the constitutional order in the HKSAR. The NPC Standing Committee's exercise of its legal mandate in accordance with the law will in no way undermine the high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR.			
The spokesperson said that the decision is another concrete step to steer ""one country, two systems"" along the right track with the aim of ensuring normal operation of the governing bodies and social stability. It is in the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including our Hong Kong compatriots, and has broad popular support. Only those legislators who refuse to shoulder their significant responsibilities to uphold ""one country, two systems"" and serve the HKSAR and its people will be affected by the decision, while the legitimate rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents remain intact.			
The spokesperson pointed out that some Western politicians have distorted the truth by vilifying China's just effort to clarify qualifications of LegCo members in accordance with the law. In total disregard of allegiance requirements for and provisions about qualifications of legislators at home and in other countries, and showing no care for Hong Kong people's fundamental interests and will, they have openly applied double standards out of entrenched ideological bias, meddled with China's internal affairs, and trampled international law and basic norms governing international relations, only to expose again their ulterior motive to embolden the anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong to continue hijacking and burning Hong Kong with them and to sow more trouble in Hong Kong. But their plot is doomed to fail.			
The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China, and no one is more earnest and determined than the Chinese government to fully and accurately implement ""one country, two systems"", or more concerned about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and its people's well-being. Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs. Any interference in Hong Kong affairs will be firmly hit back by all Chinese people, including our Hong Kong compatriots, and any attempt to play Hong Kong as a card against China will reach a dead end.

	Taiwan expects local COVID-19 vaccine by next June

	TAIPEI, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's epidemic monitoring agency said Wednesday that a locally-developed COVID-19 vaccine is likely to go on the market as soon as June next year.		
A website opened Wednesday allowing local residents to register as participants in clinical trials for locally-developed COVID-19 vaccines, with the aim of recruiting at least 20,000 volunteers by Nov. 30, said Chen Shih-chung, the agency's chief, at a weekly press briefing.			
The website is aimed at helping the developers of vaccines expand their volunteer pool, he said.			
Four people tested positive for COVID-19 in Taiwan on Wednesday, raising the total number of infections to 584, according to the agency.			
Three of the new cases came to Taiwan for work from Indonesia on Oct. 28. Having stayed in three quarantine stations, they took the COVID-19 tests on Nov. 9 and tested positive on Wednesday, though none of them have shown symptoms, according to the agency.			
The most recent case, a Belgian national, arrived in Taiwan on Oct. 25 and experienced a diminished sense of taste and smell on Oct. 31, but he did not report the symptoms because they disappeared the following day. He took the test on Nov. 10 at the request of his Taiwan business partner and the result came back positive on Wednesday.

	Political groups in Hong Kong voice support for decision on qualification of HKSAR LegCo members		
	11/11/2020 23:26		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Major political groups in Hong Kong on Wednesday expressed firm support for the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Legislative Council (LegCo) members.		
The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following the decision adopted by China's top legislature.			
Pro-establishment LegCo members held a press meeting, saying that it is a decision made by NPC Standing Committee at the constitutional level and has constitutional status and legal effect.			
Some opposition lawmakers, said the pro-establishment lawmakers, have always been hostile to the central authorities and resistant to the Chinese mainland.			
They have repeatedly tested the bottom line of ""one country, two systems"" and the red line of the national security law in Hong Kong with their words and deeds, and abused LegCo procedure rules in an attempt to paralyze the governance of the LegCo and the government, said the pro-establishment lawmakers.			
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said this decision excludes people who endanger the interests of the country and Hong Kong from serving as LegCo members, which helps safeguard national security and interests, safeguard Hong Kong's social stability and ensure that ""one country, two systems"" will always develop in the right direction.			
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions said the decision is constitutional and legal, defines the bottom line and the political ethics that LegCo members should conform to, firmly grasp the correct direction of ""one country, two systems"", and safeguard the fundamental interests and wishes of the vast majority of Hong Kong residents.			
The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong said the decision is also of great significance to Hong Kong's full and accurate implementation of the basic law and should be supported by all sectors of Hong Kong society.			
The New People's Party said the decision sets clear norms for the future conduct of LegCo members. It is hoped that the decision can set things right and more people who truly love their country and Hong Kong will run for the LegCo in the future, so that the work of the LegCo can develop in the right direction in accordance with the basic law.			
The Liberal Party of Hong Kong said the decision not only deals with the issue of extending the qualifications of members of the current LegCo, but also applies to similar situations that may occur in the future, pointing out the direction for the improvement of the mechanism.			
HKCPPCC (Provincial) Members Association said the decision is based on sufficient legal basis to ensure that Hong Kong is governed by Hong Kong people with patriots as the main body, and at the same time has a solid foundation of public opinion. Enditem"

	DPP authority's moves seeking "Taiwan independence" dangerous: spokesperson		
	11/11/2020 22:28		
	BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese mainland spokesperson warned on Wednesday that it is very dangerous for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in Taiwan to collude with the United States and use military means in its attempts to seek "Taiwan independence."		
We firmly oppose any official exchange and military contact between the United States and Taiwan,"" Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference when responding to reports that the United States had sent Marine Corps to Taiwan.			
Zhu urged the DPP authority to immediately stop collusion with the United States in any form and do not go further down the dead-end road of seeking ""Taiwan independence"" and do not drive Taiwan compatriots to disasters.			
The DPP authority's moves to bank on foreign support and develop relations with the United States under the pretext of economy and commerce will only plunge Taiwan into a situation where it is further manipulated by the United States, and harm the interests of Taiwan compatriots, Zhu said.

	Chinese top legislature's decision on qualification of HKSAR LegCo members constitutional, legal, reasonable: HKSAR chief executive

	Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam answers questions from the media during a press conference in Hong Kong, south China, Nov. 11, 2020. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)		
HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is constitutional, legal and reasonable, and fully conforms to the relevant provisions of the basic law, Chief Executive of the HKSAR Carrie Lam said Wednesday.			
The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following a decision adopted by China's top legislature.			
Lam said Hong Kong will need to straighten out and amend its local laws to comply with the relevant decisions of the NPC Standing Committee.			
She pointed out that the NPC Standing Committee is a permanent body of the highest organ of state power. It has the power to interpret and supervise the implementation of the basic law and to deal with constitutional issues according to law.			
The LegCo General Election was postponed for a year owing to the severe COVID-19 epidemic situation. To resolve the problem of a lacuna in the legislature arising from the postponement, the NPC Standing Committee on Aug. 11 passed a decision for the sixth LegCo of the HKSAR to continue to discharge duties, which did not touch upon the issue of whether or not the sixth-term LegCo members should stay.			
The HKSAR government has earlier endorsed and supported the decision to invalidate the nominations to stand for the seventh-term LegCo election of those who could not genuinely support the Basic Law and fulfill their duties as LegCo members.			
Lam said a person who does not meet the requirements for running does not meet the requirements for a LegCo member. If unqualified persons are allowed to serve as LegCo members, it is obviously a departure from the Article 104 of the basic law.			
According to the article, when assuming office, the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council and of the Legislative Council, judges of the courts at all levels and other members of the judiciary in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must, in accordance with law, swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.			
Since the interpretation of the Article 104 was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee in 2016, the HKSAR government has been actively studying ways to amend the local legislation, including specifying forms of oath, arrangement of oath supervisor, and the handling mechanism and consequences for breach of oath. The HKSAR government will complete the study and bill drafting as soon as possible and hopes to introduce the bill to the LegCo as soon as possible to implement the constitutional responsibility of the Article 104 and relevant interpretation.

	Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam answers questions from the media during a press conference in Hong Kong, south China, Nov. 11, 2020. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is constitutional, legal and reasonable, and fully conforms to the relevant provisions of the basic law, Chief Executive of the HKSAR Carrie Lam said Wednesday.		
	The HKSAR government announced the disqualification of four LegCo members following a decision adopted by China's top legislature.		
	Lam said Hong Kong will need to straighten out and amend its local laws to comply with the relevant decisions of the NPC Standing Committee.		
	She pointed out that the NPC Standing Committee is a permanent body of the highest organ of state power. It has the power to interpret and supervise the implementation of the basic law and to deal with constitutional issues according to law.		
	The LegCo General Election was postponed for a year owing to the severe COVID-19 epidemic situation. To resolve the problem of a lacuna in the legislature arising from the postponement, the NPC Standing Committee on Aug. 11 passed a decision for the sixth LegCo of the HKSAR to continue to discharge duties, which did not touch upon the issue of whether or not the sixth-term LegCo members should stay.		
	The HKSAR government has earlier endorsed and supported the decision to invalidate the nominations to stand for the seventh-term LegCo election of those who could not genuinely support the Basic Law and fulfill their duties as LegCo members.		
	Lam said a person who does not meet the requirements for running does not meet the requirements for a LegCo member. If unqualified persons are allowed to serve as LegCo members, it is obviously a departure from the Article 104 of the basic law.		
	According to the article, when assuming office, the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council and of the Legislative Council, judges of the courts at all levels and other members of the judiciary in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must, in accordance with law, swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.		
	Since the interpretation of the Article 104 was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee in 2016, the HKSAR government has been actively studying ways to amend the local legislation, including specifying forms of oath, arrangement of oath supervisor, and the handling mechanism and consequences for breach of oath. The HKSAR government will complete the study and bill drafting as soon as possible and hopes to introduce the bill to the LegCo as soon as possible to implement the constitutional responsibility of the Article 104 and relevant interpretation.

	DPP's attempts to seek mainland-Taiwan economic "decoupling" doomed to fail: spokesperson		
	11/11/2020 21:04		
	BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Cross-Strait trade and commerce benefit Taiwan compatriots and provide bright prospects for Taiwan's development, thus any retrogressive scheme that seeks "economic decoupling" between the mainland and Taiwan is doomed to fail, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday.		
Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks when asked about such attempts by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority in Taiwan.			
Mainland customs data showed the cross-Strait trade volume from January to October totaled 209.56 billion U.S. dollars, up 13 percent year on year.			
Taiwan's exports to the mainland and Hong Kong accounted for 43.6 percent of the island's total exports from January to October, according to data from the island.			
The data showed the strong resilience of cross-Strait economic and trade cooperation, and any act of ""economic decoupling"" will be futile, she said.			
With a population of 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of 400 million, the mainland will only open its door wider and provide more cooperation opportunities, said Zhu. Enditem"

	Spotlight: Hong Kong consumers join Singles' Day shopping carnival

	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite various sales promotions in brick-and-mortar stores, consumers in Hong Kong, the oriental "shopping paradise," have been eager to join their mainland compatriots in celebrating this year's Singles' Day shopping festival.		
Round-the-clock livestreaming promotion is offered besides coupons and cash returns. The Hong Kong station of Alibaba's e-commerce platform Tmall had introduced a series of measures to tap the potential of local residents' demand for mainland products weeks in the run-up to one of the world's largest online shopping seasons.			
Mrs Lee got up early on Wednesday and the first thing she did was to pay for a dozen of products in her Tmall shopping cart.			
I never expected so many unique choices in the online supermarket, especially rice noodles. I bought quite a few flavors originated from different parts of China. These niche noodles are nowhere to buy in Hong Kong,"" she said.			
Besides, she also bought some toys for her children. ""The prices are very reasonable and the delivery is also quick and convenient at your doorstep,"" she added.			
More than 250,000 brands and 5 million merchants have participated in this year's shopping spree, according to Tmall.			
Chen Zijian, director of Tmall's Hong Kong and Macao businesses, said they are very optimistic about the situation this year and the online traffic is better than expected. After several years of localized operation, customers have been more familiar with the platform than before and their participation is also growing.			
During the epidemic, I often bought some disinfectant wipes and kitchen tissues on Tmall, which are much cheaper than those in Hong Kong. For example, a pack of 75-percent alcohol wipes costs more than 40 Hong Kong dollars, but you can buy 4 packs with just 26 yuan on Tmall,"" Mr So, a Hong Kong resident, said.			
This shift in shopping patterns has to do with the rapid rise of quality mainland goods in recent years and the COVID-19 pandemic is also a game-changer.			
Mainland brands have become better in quality, design and technology, and consumers have become more confident in ""Made in China,"" said Katie Sham, a principal of leading consulting company Oliver Wyman.			
Sham said the epidemic has hit Hong Kong's brick-and-mortar retail sector, but it has also accelerated the growth of the online retail market, adding that the shift of offline to online platforms such as Tmall's Hong Kong station is crucial to the recovery of the Hong Kong retailing and will gradually change the shopping preferences and behaviors of Hong Kong consumers.			
Due to the epidemic, more and more residents in Hong Kong have started shopping online. Many people even purchased mainland products on Taobao and other websites early ahead of the Nov. 11 shopping festival. This will be a trend in the future,"" said Tsoi Chung-kin, chairman of Hong Kong's Retail & Wholesale Trades Employees Association.

	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government decided on Wednesday to launch the "Return2hk" travel scheme which allows Hong Kong residents returning from neighboring Guangdong Province or the Macao SAR to be exempted from a 14-day quarantine on meeting certain requirements since Nov. 23.		
Tommy Yuen, Director for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs (Special Duties) of the HKSAR government, told a press conference that since the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Guangdong Province and the Macao SAR is relatively stable and under control, the HKSAR government decided to launch the scheme as a first step to gradually and orderly open up normal personnel exchanges between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.			
Under the scheme, returnees from Guangdong or Macao need to apply for a specific quota and meet certain requirements to skip the mandatory quarantine, including possession of a proof of a valid negative nucleic acid test result issued by recognized institutions upon arrival in Hong Kong.			
Yuen said that at the beginning, a daily quota of 3,000 would be set at the Shenzhen Bay Port and 2,000 at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port. Enditem"

	China's top legislature's decision on qualification of HKSAR LegCo members unchallengeable: central gov't office		
	11/11/2020 17:24		
	BEIJING, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council on Wednesday said the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) on the qualification of members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has unchallengeable legal authority.		
The decision provides a solid legal basis for regulating and dealing with matters concerning the qualification of LegCo members, said the office in a statement.			
The office said it resolutely supports the decision and supports the HKSAR government's announcement to disqualify members of the sixth LegCo, including Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, in accordance with law.			
The statement noted that it has been determined in accordance with law that the disqualified members have failed to genuinely uphold the HKSAR Basic Law or to honor their pledge of allegiance to the HKSAR, and were disqualified from the election of the SAR's seventh LegCo.			
As a natural result, they are no longer eligible to hold their LegCo seats while the sixth LegCo continues performing duties.			
This is a requisite for safeguarding the principle and bottom-line of ""one country, two systems"" and for upholding the authority of the Constitution and the Basic Law, the statement said.			
This is also a common call from all upright people in Hong Kong, it added.			
The statement said the decision bears important significance to fully and faithfully implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle, protecting the HKSAR's constitutional order as defined in the Constitution and the Basic Law, safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining Hong Kong's social stability.			
The HKSAR government's announcement of the disqualifications has fully shown the justness and authority of the rule of law, the statement said.			
The statement stressed that any attempt to seize personal political interests by confronting the NPC Standing Committee's decision or by challenging the central authority's power and the authority of the Basic Law is ""doomed to be nothing but a demagogic and vain farce.""			
There should never be a place in HKSAR's political power organs including its administrative, legislative and judicial organs for any people who advocate or support ""Hong Kong independence,"" disavow the country's sovereignty and its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, seek foreign or external forces' intervention in HKSAR's affairs or conduct other acts undermining the country's national security, the statement said.			
It is a basic requirement for patriotic people governing Hong Kong, the statement said.			
The statement also called for further improvement of relevant systems and mechanisms to secure the implementation of the policy of ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"" with patriots playing the principal role in governance and to ensure that the practice of ""one country, two systems"" is carried out along a right path and is not bent or distorted.			
The decision is conducive to ensuring the sixth LegCo to continue operation smoothly, the statement read, adding that it has also created favorable conditions for the HKSAR government to concentrate on boosting the economy, ensuring people's livelihood and solving deep-seated problems. Enditem"

	Designated flights under Hong Kong-Singapore Air Travel Bubble to launch Nov. 22		
	11/11/2020 14:18		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government Wednesday announced that the bilateral Air Travel Bubble (ATB) between Hong Kong and Singapore with designated flights will be launched on Nov. 22.		
Under the ATB arrangement, travelers between the two places will not be subject to any quarantine arrangements upon arrival, nor restrictions to their travel purposes or itineraries on the condition that they comply with a set of anti-epidemic protocols.			
There are stringent measures in place to safeguard public health under the arrangement, including mutually recognized COVID-19 tests, designated flights for ATB passengers as well as a scalable mechanism to adjust the ATB arrangement having regard to the epidemic situation. All measures are meant to resume cross-border air travel in a safe and progressive manner.			
On COVID-19 testing, the ATB travelers must have tested negative in mutually recognized tests taken within 72 hours before their departure. They must also have no travel history to any places other than Singapore or Hong Kong in the last 14 days prior to their departure.			
All ATB travelers must undertake COVID-19 tests again via a designated lane at the airport upon arrival at Hong Kong, and then wait at a restricted area of the airport until the receipt of negative test results so that they may leave the airport and start their itineraries.			
The ATB travelers must travel on designated flights to minimize risks. The number of designated flights arriving at Hong Kong will increase progressively, from one flight per day in the first 15 days to two flights per day thereafter depending on the actual implementation. Each designated flight can carry a maximum of 200 ATB travelers.			
In addition, there is a scalable mechanism under the ATB arrangement. If the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local COVID-19 cases is more than five for either Singapore or Hong Kong, the ATB arrangement will be suspended for two weeks. If the relevant figure reported on the last day of the suspension period does not exceed the specified threshold of five, the ATB arrangement can resume.			
Edward Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the HKSAR government, said at a press conference on Wednesday that this is the very first ATB for Hong Kong. He hoped that aviation, tourism, hotel, retail and catering businesses can benefit from it, thereby enabling Hong Kong's economy to recover gradually.			
Yau said that not only will the implementation of the ATB arrangement facilitate resumption of air travel between Hong Kong and Singapore, but will also help enable Hong Kong's discussions with places, with epidemic situations controlled, on resuming cross-border travel in an orderly manner.

	HKSAR gov't strongly opposes so-called U.S. sanctions over national security law		
	11/10/2020 23:33		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Tuesday that it strongly opposed the so-called sanctions by the U.S. government against four Chinese mainland and Hong Kong officials.		
The HKSAR government said it is not intimidated by such despicable behavior, and will resolutely continue to implement the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR.			
The United States announced so-called sanctions against two heads of Chinese government agencies responsible for Hong Kong affairs and two HKSAR government officials on the grounds that Hong Kong implemented the national security law.			
The repeated blatant and barbaric interference in the internal affairs of the HKSAR by the U.S. government is another vivid example of unreasonable bullying act against the Central People's Government and the HKSAR government officials who safeguard national security. This will undermine Hong Kong-U.S. relations at various levels, and is resented by many people locally and around the world,"" a spokesperson of the HKSAR government stressed.			
Laws governing national security are matters for the sovereign state, regardless of whether it is a unitary or federal system of government. Enforcement of national security is likewise under the purview of the central authorities,"" said the spokesperson.			
The national security law for Hong Kong, enacted by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, is in line with all these general features, and in recognition of the HKSAR's special status, authorizes the HKSAR government to be the main enforcement entity, the spokesperson said.			
Article 4 of the national security law for Hong Kong specifies that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents under the HKSAR Basic Law as well as the provisions in international covenants as applied to Hong Kong shall be protected in accordance with the law,"" said the spokesperson.			
The duty to safeguard national security is an immense responsibility, protecting the life and interests of the 7.5 million Hong Kong residents as well as the 1.4 billion people in the mainland. The HKSAR government will continue to safeguard national security without fear, the spokesperson said. Enditem"

	Taiwan records highest number of weekly new COVID-19 cases since April		
	11/8/2020 23:58		
	TAIPEI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has recorded 19 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, the highest weekly figure since April, the local epidemic monitoring agency said Sunday.		
With the pandemic escalating around the world, Taiwan is facing mounting pressure over epidemic control, Lo Yi-chun, an official with the agency told a press conference.			
Lo attributed the high weekly figure to the increase in number of imported COVID-19 cases as the epidemic sees a resurgence in Europe, North America and some parts of Asia.			
Last week also saw a large number of students and workers from outside Taiwan finishing their quarantine and taking the tests as requested, he added.			
The new cases were detected during quarantine and hardly affected local communities, Lo said, adding that the authorities will step up containment measures related to travelers and try their best to prevent a second outbreak in Taiwan.			
Four persons who had traveled from Indonesia and the Philippines tested positive for COVID-19 in Taiwan Sunday, bringing the island's total number of infections to 577.			
Among the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan, seven died, 524 recovered, and 46 others remain hospitalized, according to the agency. Enditem"

	Hong Kong to conduct large-scale population census in 2021		
	11/8/2020 19:57		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government will conduct a large-scale population census that cover the whole population in Hong Kong from June to August in 2021, a HKSAR government official said on Sunday.		
Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government, said in his blog that the census will enable the HKSAR government to compile information on the social and economic characteristics of the Hong Kong population.			
With the latest and comprehensive data of Hong Kong and a clearer picture of the society's situation, the HKSAR government can formulate policies and allocate resources in a more responsive way to align with the development of the society and better meet people's needs, he said.			
As the COVID-19 epidemic may bring uncertainty to the census work, Chan said, the Census and Statistics Department of the HKSAR government will further enhance the use of information technology for data collection.			
Since 1961, it has become an established practice for Hong Kong to conduct a population census every ten years and a by-census in the middle of the intercensal period. Population censuses were conducted in 1961, 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 while population by-censuses in 1966, 1976, 1986, 1996 and 2006. Enditem"

	Better integration into nation's overall development helps Hong Kong boost economy: senior HKSAR gov't official		
	11/8/2020 19:38		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Matthew Cheung, chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said on Sunday that Hong Kong's better integration into the overall development of the country is an important driving force for the resumption of Hong Kong's economic growth.		
Cheung said in his blog that China has resolved to expand its opening up, offering a golden opportunity for Hong Kong's economic development, and it is certain that Hong Kong can better integrate into the overall development of the country by actively participating in the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and playing its key role in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) international cooperation.			
Cheung said that the proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 mentioned the maintenance of Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, and emphasized the full and accurate implementation of the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" ""the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.			
Cheung said the enactment of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR at the state level has brought about remarkable results in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, strengthening the framework of ""one country, two systems,"" and restoring Hong Kong's stability.			
He said the country's success in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and its rapid economic recovery are encouraging. The HKSAR government will spare no efforts in combating the disease by taking prudent and strict preventive and control measures and strive to resume cross-boundary people flow with the mainland and Macao to revitalize the local economy.

	Fifth anniversary of historic cross-Strait meeting marked in Taipei		
	11/7/2020 23:47		
	TAIPEI, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- A symposium was held Saturday in Taipei to mark the fifth anniversary of the historic meeting between leaders across the Taiwan Strait.		
In a speech at the symposium, Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwan's former leader and head of the Ma Ying-jeou Foundation, said that the historic meeting five years ago built a ""bridge for peace across the Strait.""			
He said that the meeting was based on a common political foundation and solid political trust accumulated by the two sides over about seven years, noting that history will not forget the efforts the two sides made to achieve the meeting.			
Ma said that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority's strategy to ""ally with the United States and confront the mainland"" will not bring Taiwan security, and he called for a return to the correct path of the 1992 Consensus and the seeking of peace across the Strait.			
At the symposium, scholars on cross-Strait relations agreed with Ma's statement and questioned whether, by spending huge sums of money on purchasing U.S. arms since they took office in 2016, the DPP authority has brought security to Taiwan.			
If cross-Strait relations had remained peaceful and stable, as they were before 2016, a huge amount of resources would have been saved to improve people's livelihood and welfare, instead of going to arms purchases, they said.			
The symposium was jointly held by the College of Social Sciences with the Taipei-based Chinese Culture University and the Ma Ying-jeou Foundation.			
In a statement on Saturday, the Kuomintang pledged that it would carry on the spirit that facilitated the historic meeting between leaders across the Strait and continue to promote cross-Strait exchanges and peace. Enditem"

	127 mainland higher education institutions to admit Hong Kong students		
	11/5/2020 17:17		
	HONG KONG, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Education Bureau (EDB) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government Thursday welcomed the announcement by the Ministry of Education on the detailed arrangements of the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions (Admission Scheme) for the 2021/22 academic year.		
The number of mainland higher education institutions participating in the Admission Scheme will increase to 127, from 21 provinces or municipalities and one autonomous region in the mainland. They will accept applications from candidates sitting for the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination in 2021.			
Compared with last year, an additional five institutions offering various programs will be participating in the Admission Scheme for the 2021/22 academic year, namely Northeast Normal University, Fujian Medical University, Hunan University of Technology, Hainan Normal University and Xidian University.			
A spokesperson for the EDB said the mainland higher education institutions participating in the Admission Scheme admit Hong Kong students based on their HKDSE Examination results, hence relieving these students' pressure from taking the Joint Entrance Examination for Mainland Institutions.			
The EDB will continue discussion with the mainland with a view to inviting more renowned mainland institutions to participate in the Admission Scheme and providing students with multiple study pathways and opportunities to connect with the country's development,"" the spokesperson said.			
There is the School Principal Nomination Scheme under the Admission Scheme and each secondary school can nominate up to eight students. The minimum entrance requirement adopted by the participating mainland institutions remains unchanged, that is, attainment in the HKDSE Examination of a total score of 10 or above in the four core subjects (i.e. Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics and Liberal Studies), and among which none of them is below 2.			
In addition, eligible Hong Kong students enrolled in undergraduate programs of designated mainland institutions can apply for a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy under the Mainland University Study Subsidy Scheme. Application details for the 2021/22 academic year will be announced in mid-2021. Enditem"
